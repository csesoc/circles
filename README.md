## about Circles
Tired of using a poorly laid out spreadsheet to cobble together a plan to follow for the next 3-8 years of your life?
have no fear! Circles is here!

Circles is a UNSW degree planner, which you can use to explore, check, and play around with your course planning.

### features

NOTE: we currently only support the Computer Science (3778) degree - but we will add more!
- adaptive course selector
    - allows you to explore your currently unlocked courses as you do more of them
    - shows you all the courses relevant to your degree
    - automatically checks if you meet the requirement to take a course

- term planner
    - an intuitive drag and drop interface for planning terms
    - validates your courses to make sure your future courses are unlocked before you take them
    - allows you to generate a savable and sharable image of your plan

### future
this project is rapidly expanding, and our roadmap includes features such as
- progression checker (NEW PAGE!)
    - allows you to check how far you are into your degree
    - lets you understand which requirements you have met and which you still need to complete
- graphical view
    - a graphical model of your degree plan, to show you a beautiful dependancy tree of courses relevant to your degree
    - will adapt to your degree structure
