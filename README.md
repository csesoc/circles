# Circles

Tired of using a poorly laid out spreadsheet to cobble together a plan to follow for the next 3-8 years of your life? Have no fear, Circles is here!

Circles is a UNSW degree planner where you can explore and validate your degree structure.

You can find a live build of Circles at [https://circles.csesoc.app](https://circles.csesoc.app/).
