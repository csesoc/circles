# Circles

Tired of using a poorly laid out spreadsheet to cobble together a plan to follow for the next 3-8 years of your life? Have no fear, Circles is here!

Circles is a UNSW degree planner where you can explore and validate your degree structure.

### Features
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csesoc/Circles/dev/frontend/src/assets/infographic.png">
NOTE: we currently only support the Computer Science (3778) degree - but we will add more!

- Adaptive course selector:
    - Allows you to explore your currently unlocked courses
    - Shows all the courses relevant to your degree
    - Automatically checks if you meet the requirement to take a course

- Term planner:
    - An intuitive drag and drop interface
    - Validates your progression to make sure you've met the requirements for future courses
    - Allows you to generate a saveable and sharable image of your plan

### Future Plans

This project is rapidly expanding and our roadmap includes features such as:

- Progression checker: (NEW PAGE!)
    - Lets you understand which requirements you have met and which you still need to complete
    - Shows you what courses you can do to complete your degree
- Graphical view:
    - A graphical model of your degree plan, to show you a beautiful dependancy tree of courses relevant to your degree
    - Will adapt to your degree structure
