/**
 * IMPORTANT NOTE:
 *
 * Since we store the state to local storage via redux-persist, this means that
 * any modifications to the state (i.e. changing the initialState data structure
 * fields, a bug created in the reducer functions that can cause some logic
 * issues, etc.) can have unintended effects for users using a previous version local
 * storage data format. This could cause Circles to break or create some weird behaviours.
 *
 * You must update/increment REDUX_STRUCTURE_VERSION value found in `constants.js`
 * to indicate is a breaking change is introduced to make it non compatible with
 * previous versions of local storage data.
