The Advanced Chinese Studies major specialisation at UNSW encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br /><br />There are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on acquiring / enhancing competence in the Chinese language. Language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform an understanding of Chinese culture. These disciplines include literary, cultural, film, translation, gender, and media studies as well as anthropological, linguistic, historical and sociological approaches.<br /><br />This specialisation is available to students commencing at Advanced, Professional and Expert entry levels.</p>",

You can enter Chinese language courses at different levels, depending on your knowledge of Chinese characters. Within each year, you are allocated to different groups, depending on your speaking ability.<br /><br />If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at: <a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placementshttps://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placements\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of Humanities and Languages - Language Placements</a><br /><br />You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you in terms of Chinese character knowledge. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.<br /><br />If you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2450 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of your degree requirements.<br /><br />You will be admitted to the Expert level of entry to the Major if you have completed high school in China or have elsewhere achieved equivalent language proficiency to a Chinese high school graduate. This level emphasises Chinese Studies (contextual and professional) courses. Since you already have a high level of language proficiency and literacy in Chinese, you will enroll in Translation and Interpreting courses as Gateway language courses \u2013 which are a requirement for the major at this entry level.</p>",

Through provisions of Australia-Japan contact situations, you will gain intercultural awareness and understanding, as well as develop your knowledge of the language, cultures, societies and communities in Japan. The Japanese language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of Japan. Japan is of increasing fundamental importance to Australia for political, strategic and economic reasons in realisation of Australia in the Asian Century. Thus, learning Japanese and developing competence in Japanese will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Japan and beyond, and enable you to take an important role in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n<p>There are two main components of Japanese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Japanese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Japanese culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social studies.</p>\n<p>This specialisation is available to students commencing at Advanced and Professional entry levels.</p>",

However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens are still used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates.</p>\n<p>UNSW is highly ranked in Anatomy and Physiology. At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology. You could pursue a career as a radiographer, forensic anthropologist, immersive (VR, AR) developer, and a data specialist. Studying anatomy also prepares students for careers in medicine and is especially relevant clinical skills, surgery and radiological imaging.</p>\n<p>Anatomy may be combined with elective courses in Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Pathology or Psychology.</p>",

However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens, along with immersive technologies such as virtual reality, are used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates.</p>\n<p>At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology.

The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. We offer expert supervision across a wide range of areas in modern mathematics and statistics. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.<br />\nStudents who enrol in the Applied Mathematics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0applied mathematics may also apply for entry to this stream.<br />\nHonours in Applied Mathematics can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources. Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>So that students have sufficient background to attempt the courses in the honours year, students must discuss their selection of Level III courses with the Applied Mathematics Honours Coordinator or another academic adviser.<br />\nTo enter honours in applied mathematics, students must have</p>\n\n<ul><li>Completed the mathematics or physical oceanography\u00a0stream in the Science or Advanced Science program, including at least 30 units of credit in Level III mathematics or statistics of which at least 18uoc must be in level III applied mathematics,\u00a0<strong>or</strong></li><li>Completed Stage 3 of\u00a0 the applied mathematics\u00a0stream in the Advanced Mathematics degree\u00a0<strong>or;</strong></li><li>Completed a suitable mathematics or statistics degree at another university.</li></ul>\n\n<p><em>In addition,</em>\u00a0students will normally be required to have:</p>\n\n<ul><li>An average above 70 in their level III mathematics or statistics courses\u00a0<strong>and</strong></li><li>An average above 70 in level III applied mathematics courses.</li></ul>\n\n<p>The level III applied mathematics courses at UNSW are those courses numbered from MATH3010 to MATH3399 inclusive.<br />\nWith the permission of the Head of School (or nominee), a student may be allowed into Applied Mathematics Honours without having satisfied the specific departmental requirements, and instead have shown some evidence of the ability to undertake independent study.</p>\n",

These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities.\u00a0Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis. Students are required to give a short seminar on their thesis and this will account for 10% of the final mark for the thesis, the remaining 90% coming from the written thesis report.</p>\n\n<p>The 30uoc coursework component of applied mathematics honours will consist of five 6uoc lecture courses at honours/postgraduate level (typically MATH5xxx courses).\u00a0 The suite of courses must be approved by the Head of School or nominee and taken with the advice of the honours thesis supervisor. A student may be permitted to take one or, exceptionally, at most two, courses from outside the School of MathsStats, for example at the AMSI summer school, at another institution or at another UNSW academic unit.</p>\n\n<p>The marks for the thesis and other honours courses will be combined to give a weighted average mark forming a final honours mark which will be rounded up and used to decide the grade of honours the student will be awarded as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Honours class 1 -- final mark of 85 or over</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 1 -- final mark from 75 to 84</li><li>Honours class 2, Division 2 -- final mark from 65 to 74</li><li>Honours class 3 -- final mark from 50 to 64</li></ul>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who successfully complete Mathematics or Statistics Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by applying to undertake postgraduate studies by PhD or Masters. Students with successful honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW.

Please refer to previous editions of the\u00a0handbook\u00a0for pre-2024 requirements.</strong></p>\n<p>Recent technological advances are bringing robots out of their usual industrial settings and into homes and offices. Mobile robots capable of vacuum cleaning and lawn mowing are already commercially available. As miniaturisation and sophistication increase and costs continue to decrease, it is anticipated that robots will become commonplace. Applications include domestic robots to assist in everyday chores, robots for entertainment or educational purposes as well as robots for automating office and factory tasks. Applications also include assistance for the elderly, in particular, to improve their mobility and level of care.</p>\n<p>As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).</p>\n<p>The Artificial Intelligence stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs focuses on the development of sophisticated software for mobile robot control. Several aspects of software are considered:</p>\n<ul><li>artificial intelligence</li><li>agent programming</li><li>experimental robotics</li><li>knowledge representation and reasoning</li><li>machine learning</li><li>robot architectures</li><li>human-computer interaction</li><li>vision</li></ul>",

        "description": "<p><strong>This handbook entry is for students commencing their studies from 2024. Please refer to previous editions of the\u00a0handbook\u00a0for pre-2024 requirements.</strong></p>\n<p>Recent technological advances are bringing robots out of their usual industrial settings and into homes and offices. Mobile robots capable of vacuum cleaning and lawn mowing are already commercially available. As miniaturisation and sophistication increase and costs continue to decrease, it is anticipated that robots will become commonplace. Applications include domestic robots to assist in everyday chores, robots for entertainment or educational purposes as well as robots for automating office and factory tasks. Applications also include assistance for the elderly, in particular, to improve their mobility and level of care.</p>\n<p>As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).</p>\n<p>The Artificial Intelligence stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs focuses on the development of sophisticated software for mobile robot control. Several aspects of software are considered:</p>\n<ul><li>artificial intelligence</li><li>agent programming</li><li>experimental robotics</li><li>knowledge representation and reasoning</li><li>machine learning</li><li>robot architectures</li><li>human-computer interaction</li><li>vision</li></ul>",

As miniaturisation and sophistication increase and costs continue to decrease, it is anticipated that robots will become commonplace. Applications include domestic robots to assist in everyday chores, robots for entertainment or educational purposes as well as robots for automating office and factory tasks. Applications also include assistance for the elderly, in particular, to improve their mobility and level of care.</p>\n\n<p>As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).</p>\n\n<p>The Artificial Intelligence stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs focuses on the development of sophisticated software for mobile robot control. Several aspects of software are considered:</p>\n\n<ul><li>artificial intelligence;</li><li>agent programming;</li><li>experimental robotics;</li><li>knowledge representation and reasoning;</li><li>machine learning;</li><li>robot architectures;</li><li>human-computer interaction;</li><li>vision.</li></ul>\n",

With the increasing demand for data analytics skills and data analysis techniques in the aviation industry, this specialisation allows students to obtain data science knowledge and data analytics skills in the Aviation Programme. In particular, four specialised courses are provided to equip students with technical skills to analyse qualitative, quantitative, and large datasets in the big-data era. Building on the fundamental statistical course in the first year of the Aviation Programme, this specialisation provides two stage-two courses to introduce research methods for analysing quantitative and qualitative data in aviation. Machine-Learning (ML) based models are taught to equip students with data science knowledge and Python programming skills in order to handle big data and data modeling in the operations of airlines and airports.</p>\n<p>Two stage-three courses are provided to equip students with advanced skills in handling flight operations-related data. This knowledge and skill to analyse flight operations data enable students to solve operation-related challenges in the airline industry such as aircraft fault prediction, aircraft maintenance scheduling, aircraft routing for maintenance, and aircraft parts inventory. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models are taught to equip students with an advanced understanding of AI theories and skills to build AI-based data analytic models in solving industrial problems. This includes using large data sets to conduct time-series analysis, seasonality analysis of passenger demand, and anomaly detection in operations and aircraft maintenance. Both data science theories and scenario-based tutorials will be provided to students with hands-on experience in solving industry-oriented problems.</p>",

Students undertake a supervised research project in an area of research significance as approved by the Head of School. The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program. A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Bioinformatics can be found at <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Bioinformatics is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516\u00a0School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Please note, the workshops&#39; exact topics and schedules may vary subject to staff availability.</p>\n\n<p>Students are required to submit exercises for feedback but does not contribute to final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature review</strong></p>\n\n<p>A major written assignment of ca. 3,000 words on the topic of each student&#39;s project and selected in consultation with the project supervisor will be written. The aim is to familiarize students with library and resource usage and to develop a critical approach in assessing published literature in the area relevant to the research project.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed feedback by primary supervisor. This is assessment of written skills that will scaffold the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the introduction of the final thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Results for this task do not contribute to the final grade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Present research plan to lab groups; 15 minutes with 5 minutes for questions</p>\n\n<p>Feedback by primary supervisor. This is assessment of oral presentation skills that will scaffold the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the final oral presentation (Presentation 2).</p>\n\n<p>Results for this task do not contribute to the final grade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice Thesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The learning goal for this assignment is to teach students to extract data from laboratory notebooks and prepare a scientific document. The text of the report should be 2000 words or less. You must stay under the word limit. Three or four figures and/or tables must be included. The text should include a brief Introduction. The focus should be on the presentation and discussion of your data. Assessors will expect figures, tables and text to be presented professionally and at the standard of an acceptable scientific journal. The grade of satisfactory or unsatisfactory is not used to predict the final outcome of the thesis, simply to indicate the committees view on the thesis as presented.</p>\n\n<p>Internally examined by at least 2 reviewers and critical feedback given to student. This task scaffolds the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the final thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Results for this task do not contribute to the final grade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice thesis interview</strong></p>\n\n<p>To facilitate feedback the Assessment Committee will interview the student to discuss the practice thesis. Students will be interviewed by their Assessment Committee to evaluate the extent of the student&#39;s knowledge and to confirm that the student is fully in possession of the contents of their thesis.</p>\n\n<p>This task serves as a major component of the student&#39;s training for writing the final thesis and as practice for the final interview. Detailed feedback concerning the expectations for preparation of the final thesis will be provided at this time.</p>\n\n<p>Results for this task do not contribute to the final grade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Present research findings; 15\u00a0minutes with 5 minutes for questions.</p>\n\n<p>Students are graded by the academics in the audience. Students are assessed based on delivery of content, background knowledge of their field, and understanding of the significance of their findings in the context of their field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>A final research thesis is to be submitted at the end of the year that details the results and significance of findings of the project undertaken.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a breakdown of the weighting of the different thesis sections:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Introduction (20%) - The literature must be adequately described and understood by the student, and critical review of the literature is an indication of thorough understanding of the topic. <em>This component comprises essentially a major literature review undertaken by the students earlier in their year in which they are provided critical feedback on.</em></li><li>Methods (10%) - The Methods section should be described in sufficient detail to allow experiments to be reproduced. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>Results (30%) - Experiments should be presented in a logical sequence and there should be enough data presented in order for the committee to assess the level of commitment to the research project. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>Discussion (30%) - Students should critically assess their own work and the work done by others, discussing the significance of their results in context with published work in the field. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>General presentation (10%) - The thesis should be well written with a minimum of errors, with accurate, complete, and error free references (both in the text and in the reference list). <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li></ul>\n\n<p>Internally examined by at least two independent reviewers. Each member of the thesis committee will independently read and assess the final thesis without consultation with each other. After meeting with the student in the final thesis interview, the student will be excused and the committee will come to an agreement on the final mark for thesis. If there is a discrepancy and the committee cannot come to an agreement on the final mark, then a fourth examiner can be called for to provide another independent assessment of the thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 80%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final thesis interview</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students will be interviewed by their Assessment Committee to evaluate the extent of the student&#39;s knowledge and to confirm that the student is fully in possession of the contents of their thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Students are graded by their committee based on their interview. Students are assessed based on their ability to articulate verbally the significance of their findings, an understanding of the methods they employed, an ability to answer questions, and a background understanding of the field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Honours Grade Calculation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class I (\u2265 85%)</p>\n\n<p>Work of excellent critical evaluation through substantial independence and self-direction, reflecting superior quality in all aspects of research, writing and presentation. The work has no significant errors or/and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class II, Division I (75% to 84%)</p>\n\n<p>Work of very good critical evaluation through substantial independence and self-direction, reflecting very good quality in all aspects of research, writing and presentation.</p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class II, Division 2 (65% to 74%)</p>\n\n<p>Work of good quality in research, writing and presentation but with some significant errors or/and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Hons. Class III (50% to 64%)</p>\n\n<p>Work is in acceptable form and demonstrates basic research, writing and presentation skills. The work has several significant deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Fail (&lt;50%)</p>\n\n<p>Work has a number of major flaws and there is evidence of lack of basic knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be reviewed by at least two internal reviewers other than the supervisor(s). A panel will then determine the allocation of final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements and Process</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Requirements</em></p>\n\n<p>Admission to Honours is competitive, and depends on academic merit as well as the availability of an approved supervisor. Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<ul><li>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</li><li>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available</li></ul>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about staff research interests and the process of applying for Honours can be found <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours-mphil-babs\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS webpage</a>. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from School of BABS webpage:<a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\"> www.babs.unsw.edu.au</a></p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Bioinformatics may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Bioinformatics have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",

Honours in Biology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and independent Research Project conducted under the close supervision of academic(s) within The School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>\n",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Biology must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Biology (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Biology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline: <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Biology receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (Local, State or Federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

The aim is to familiarise students with library usage and to develop a critical approach to assessing published literature in the area relevant to the research project. A second important aim is for the student to develop appropriate writing skills. Supervisors will therefore read and comment on drafts of the literature review. In their assessment, supervisors will be looking for evidence of thorough scrutiny of the relevant literature and appropriate presentation of the material. Although this does not constitute a formal part of the final grade it is necessary for students to demonstrate their literacy skills at an early stage.</li><li><strong>Final Seminar: </strong>Each student will present a seminar on outcomes of his/her research project towards the end of their project. This component is worth 5% of the final mark. This is a 15-20 minute powerpoint presentation to the School and is assessed by academics in attendance at the seminar.</li><li><strong>Thesis: </strong>A written manuscript summarising the research and results of the Research Project under the direction of a duly appointed Supervisor. This manuscript is a maximum of 70 pages and is marked by two assigned Examiners (supervisor and one other). This component contributes 75% to the final Grade for the project.</li></ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There are other compulsory activities which do not contribute to your grades but are required for the successful completion of the Program in the School of BABS.

Identifying and negotiating with prospective supervisors is up to applicants, and applicants need to align their interest with the research area of one of the School&#39;s academics.</p>\n\n<p>Once agreement has been reached with a suitable academic staff member, an application for Postgraduate study through UNSW Apply Online (<a href=\"https://apply.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://apply.unsw.edu.au</a>) is required. Agreement of a supervisor is not a guarantee of admission but required before an application will be considered. Admission also depends on the resources of the School and supervisor availability, and is ultimately at the discretion of the Head of School or nominee.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who successfully complete the Graduate Diploma (Research) with a sufficiently high weighted average mark are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level).<br />\n<br />\nGraduates are also well qualified to work in various endeavours, which include: patent law specialising in scientific patents, management in technological companies, scientific research and commercial applications, science journalism, forensic science, pollution control, diagnostic microbiology and immunology, and sales and technical specialists in science-based industries.</p>\n",

Workshops are held in the first week of Honours. Please note, the workshops&#39; exact topics and schedules may vary subject to staff availability.</p>\n\n<p>Students are required to submit exercises for feedback but does not contribute to final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Literature review</strong></p>\n\n<p>A major written assignment of ca. 3,000 words on the topic of each student&#39;s project and selected in consultation with the project supervisor will be written. The aim is to familiarize students with library and resource usage and to develop a critical approach in assessing published literature in the area relevant to the research project.</p>\n\n<p>Detailed feedback by primary supervisor. This is assessment of written skills that will scaffold the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the introduction of the final thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>Present research plan to lab groups; 15 minutes with 5 minutes for questions</p>\n\n<p>Feedback by primary supervisor. This is assessment of oral presentation skills that will scaffold the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the final oral presentation (Presentation 2).</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice Thesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>The learning goal for this assignment is to teach students to extract data from laboratory notebooks and prepare a scientific document. The text of the report should be 2000 words or less. You must stay under the word limit. Three or four figures and/or tables must be included. The text should include a brief Introduction. The focus should be on the presentation and discussion of your data. Assessors will expect figures, tables and text to be presented professionally and at the standard of an acceptable scientific journal. The grade of satisfactory or unsatisfactory is not used to predict the final outcome of the thesis, simply to indicate the committees view on the thesis as presented.</p>\n\n<p>Internally examined by at least 2 reviewers and critical feedback given to student. This task scaffolds the student learning and provides formative assessment leading to the final summative assessment in the final thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice thesis interview</strong></p>\n\n<p>To facilitate feedback the Assessment Committee will interview the student to discuss the practice thesis. Students will be interviewed by their Assessment Committee to evaluate the extent of the student&#39;s knowledge and to confirm that the student is fully in possession of the contents of their thesis.</p>\n\n<p>This task serves as a major component of the student&#39;s training for writing the final thesis and as practice for the final interview. Detailed feedback concerning the expectations for preparation of the final thesis will be provided at this time.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: None</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Present research findings; 15\u00a0minutes with 5 minutes for questions.</p>\n\n<p>Students are graded by the academics in the audience. Students are assessed based on delivery of content, background knowledge of their field, and understanding of the significance of their findings in the context of their field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thesis</strong></p>\n\n<p>A final research thesis is to be submitted at the end of the year that details the results and significance of findings of the project undertaken.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a breakdown of the weighting of the different thesis sections:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Introduction (20%) - The literature must be adequately described and understood by the student, and critical review of the literature is an indication of thorough understanding of the topic. <em>This component comprises essentially a major literature review undertaken by the students earlier in their year in which they are provided critical feedback on.</em></li><li>Methods (10%) - The Methods section should be described in sufficient detail to allow experiments to be reproduced. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>Results (30%) - Experiments should be presented in a logical sequence and there should be enough data presented in order for the committee to assess the level of commitment to the research project. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>Discussion (30%) - Students should critically assess their own work and the work done by others, discussing the significance of their results in context with published work in the field. <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li><li>General presentation (10%) - The thesis should be well written with a minimum of errors, with accurate, complete, and error free references (both in the text and in the reference list). <em>This component the student will have been provided critical feedback on from their practice thesis earlier in the year.</em></li></ul>\n\n<p>Internally examined by at least 2 independent reviewers. Internally examined by at least two independent reviewers. Each member of the thesis committee will independently read and assess the final thesis without consultation with each other. After meeting with the student in the final thesis interview, the student will be excused and the committee will come to an agreement on the final mark for thesis. If there is a discrepancy and the committee cannot come to an agreement on the final mark, then a fourth examiner can be called for to provide another independent assessment of the thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 80%</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final thesis interview</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students will be interviewed by their Assessment Committee to evaluate the extent of the student&#39;s knowledge and to confirm that the student is fully in possession of the contents of their thesis.</p>\n\n<p>Students are graded by their committee based on their interview. Students are assessed based on their ability to articulate verbally the significance of their findings, an understanding of the methods they employed, an ability to answer questions, and a background understanding of the field of study.</p>\n\n<p>Contribution to final grade: 10%</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Honours Grade Calculation</strong><br />\n<br />\nHons.

The work has several significant deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>Fail (&lt;50%)</p>\n\n<p>Work has a number of major flaws and there is evidence of lack of basic knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be reviewed by at least two internal reviewers other than the supervisor(s). A panel will then determine the allocation of final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements and Process</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Requirements</em></p>\n\n<p>Admission to Honours is competitive, and depends on academic merit as well as the availability of an approved supervisor. Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about the process of applying for Honours can be found here <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours</a>, and other appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Biotechnology may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Biotechnology have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Chemical Product Engineering involves researching, developing and improving the properties of the products that we use every day through the selection and design of the materials that are used. Product engineers work on the fluids that you use in your everyday life, including chemicals (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, shampoos, paints, glues), foods, and drinks. As a product engineer, you will learn to take consumer needs and turn them into technical requirements, finding the right combinations of chemicals to deliver those properties and then developing the product and strategies for commercialisation and manufacture. You will learn how to apply your knowledge of engineering and chemistry to design complex chemical products for the pharmaceutical, consumer products and food industries. You&#39;ll master the entire development process, testing out ideas for products and extrapolating small scale, laboratory chemistry into large, industrial scale production. In the final year Product Design Project, you will work with industry partners to develop a new consumer product up to the point where it could be patented and commercialised. To get work ready, you&#39;ll apply these skills through 60 days of approved industry training.<br /><br />The courses listed below have to be completed to finish the degree, but the order in which they are taken is important and you need to follow advice on this. Many courses are offered only once per year and others have pre-requisites or exclusions which govern the order in which they can be taken. Both of these things can have a big impact on enrolment planning if poor choices of course combinations are made. You are strongly encouraged to consult the School website and follow the recommended course sequence linked <a href=\"https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/study-with-us/undergraduate-degrees/chemical-product-engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br /><br />The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimise your choice of courses. It is your responsibility to plan your enrolment appropriately. Assistance is available from Engineering Student Support Services, should you require it.</p>",

As such, many fields of science involve an understanding and/or application of chemistry or materials derived from chemical processes. Since the mid-20th century six notable Australians have won Nobel prizes for their contributions to science , which involved significant aspects of chemistry. These include Sir John Cornforth; and for Medicine with a substantial chemistry component - Florey (1945), - MacFarlane Burnett (1960), - Eccles (1963), - Doherty (1996) and - Blackburn (2009). W.H. Bragg, W.L Bragg won the prize in Physics (1915), which led to major advances in chemistry, biology and material science.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry has prominence in the modern world via applications involving nanotechnologies and popular compact electronic devices of everyday use. However, there are many more chemical uses that that support modern society and occupy many roles without being noticed or even pondered.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry is science at the molecular level. Chemical science underpins defence technology at every level from lasers and high-speed computers to food science and energetic materials. Ordnance and Engineering are particular areas where UNSW Canberra Chemistry majors have found employment.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry is divided into several sub-fields. The School of PEMS has strengths in Physical and Theoretical Chemistry as well as Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. Within each of these sub-fields there are specialist fields of laser spectroscopy, biological chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, explosives and molecular design. As well as teaching, academic staff carry out research in these fields. Fourth year Honours and higher degree by research (MSc, PhD) programs are available within a range of specified areas.</p>\n",

Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via the Chemistry Research page.<br />Pathways<br />Students who successfully complete Chemistry Honours are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students with successful Honours are qualified to enrol in a PhD program at UNSW. Students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies. Further information can be obtained from the postgraduate studies page.<br /><br />Graduates of Chemistry Honours are well qualified to work in any Chemistry or associated research laboratory as a Research Assistant or Research Technician. Graduates may also find employment in the public or private sectors either using their chemistry skills directly, or alternatively in a range of other fields using the analytical and research skills developed during the Honours year.

Inclusion of advanced level studies from more than one field of specialisation results in a broadly based degree in the chemical sciences. For example, a combination of Chemistry and Biochemistry leads to further work in areas such as toxicology and neurochemistry.

Inclusion of advanced level studies from more than one field of specialisation results in a broadly based degree in the chemical sciences. For example, a combination of Chemistry and Biochemistry leads to further work in areas such as toxicology and neurochemistry. Combining Level III Chemistry with Mathematics provides a valuable basis for the many applications of computers in Chemistry. Chemistry with Physics or Materials Science allows entry into the rapidly developing field of advanced materials.",

The Chinese Studies major at UNSW encompasses the study of Chinese language and communication as well as culture, society and civilisation, including Chinese literature, cinema, history, politics and philosophy. A background in Chinese Studies is useful in many areas of professional specialisation, from commerce and the business sector to tourism, the media, the public service sector and education.<br /><br />There are two main components of Chinese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Chinese language. Acquiring language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of socio-cultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending others\u2019 expression, both oral and written. The ability to read written texts is an important part of this process. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Chinese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform an understanding of Chinese culture. These disciplines include literary, cultural, film, translation, gender, and media studies as well as anthropological, linguistic, historical and sociological approaches.<br /><br />This specialisation is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>",

You can enter Chinese language courses at different levels, depending on your knowledge of Chinese characters. Within each year, you are allocated to different groups, depending on your speaking ability.<br /><br />If you have prior language knowledge you will need to take an online placement evaluation so that we can assess your skills and select an appropriate level of course for you. Information about the evaluation and additional course details can be found on the web at:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placements\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of Humanities and Languages - Language Placements</a><br /><br />You will not be permitted to enrol in language courses that are too easy for you in terms of Chinese character knowledge. If this occurs, you will be requested to change your enrolment.<br /><br />If you are admitted in your first year of study to ARTS2450 or higher on the grounds of your ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of your degree requirements.</p>",

Honours in Climate Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in climate dynamics, global climate change, and extremes of weather and climate. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include a literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial\u00a0 independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics in the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

This component is completed under the direction of a duly appointed Honours Supervisor. This Research Proposal is graded by two independent Examiners and forms 12.5% of the total Honours Grade.<br /><br /><strong>Project Thesis</strong><br /><br />This component\u00a0is completed under the direction of a duly appointed Honours Supervisor. This project works towards the completion of a written manuscript summarising the research and results of the Research Project. This manuscript is a maximum of 8,000 words and is marked by the two assigned Examiners.

This seminar is assessed by members of the School of BEES Honours Committee and is worth 5% of the total Honours Grade.<br /><br />There are other compulsory activities which do not contribute to an Honours Grade but are required for the successful completion of the Honours Program in the School of BEES. These include:</p>\n<ul><li>Attendance at Honours program classes which includes a Peer Reviewed Introductory Seminar;</li><li>Submission of a Problem Statement (staff graded);</li><li>Attendance at a Risk Management Workshop, an Ethics Workshop and Professional Development Workshops;</li><li>Attendance at School seminars.</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Honours Grade Calculation</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Literature Review and Research Proposal (12.5%)</li><li>Project Thesis/Manuscript (82.5%)</li><li>Final Seminar (5%)</li></ul>\n<p>A guide to allocation of Honours classes and what is expected of students within the School of BEES is as follows:\u00a0<br /><br /><em>Honours Grade &gt;85 (Honours Class 1)</em><br />Work of superior quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, demonstrating the ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, the integration of information from a wide range of sources and containing clear examples of excellent critical evaluation.<br /><br /><em>Honours Grade 75-84 (Honours Class 2.1)</em><br />Work of very good quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, but showing lesser ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, integrate information from range of sources and critically evaluate the literature and research data.<br /><br /><em>Honours Grade 65-74 (Honours Class 2.2)</em><br />Good quality in all aspects research, scientific writing, and oral presentation but with inadequacies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.<br /><br /><em>Honours Grade 50-64 (Honours Class 3)</em><br />Adequate quality work with significant deficiencies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.<br /><br /><strong>Admission Requirements and Process</strong><br /><br /><em>Admission Requirements</em>\u00a0<br /><br />The BEES Climate Science Honours Program is available to all students who have met the entry requirements outlined below and is typically offered to Bachelor of Science (3970) and Bachelor of Science Environmental Management (3965) students who have completed a relevant Major sequence. Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.<br /><br />Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.<br /><br />Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.<br /><br /><em>Admission Process</em><br /><br />Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Climate Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.<br /><br /><strong>Pathways</strong><br /><br />Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Climate Science receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.<br /><br />Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Not only do personal computer systems, such as desktops and laptops fall into this category, but so do embedded systems for gaming, cars and PDAs, supercomputers used in climate modelling and gene analysis, and prosthetic systems such as ocular implants intended to improve quality of life. The challenge for the engineer is to design these systems with maximal impact, and to trade off competing factors using engineering, scientific and mathematical principles. This stream teaches the principles and techniques necessary to engineer high quality systems.</p>\n\n<p>Computer Engineering is studied as a major stream in the BE(Hons). Day to day administration of this stream is conducted through the Computer Science and Engineering Student Office.</p>\n\n<p>This page outlines the core rules for the Computer Engineering stream when taken as part of a single or dual award. The requirements total 168 units of credit, plus 60 days of industrial training. Refer to the program page for full details on the overall program requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Further details on the stream requirements, electives, and advice regarding the order and placement of courses in the stream can be found at the:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/studying-at-unsw/undergraduate/program-options/computer-engineering/single-award/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School website</a></p>\n",

        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), once simply a branch of computing research, has over the last decade moved into the mainstream of computational problem solving techniques. Many systems, from search engines to financial systems and health systems employ AI techniques such as machine learning. While true &#39;intelligence&#39; via computers is still remote, AI techniques are increasingly being used to enhance the performance of a vast range of existing systems, and to enable new applications, especially those involving large amounts of data.<br />\n<br />\nIn many applications (e.g. driverless vehicles), AI allows existing systems to work with less and less manual intervention. As autonomous devices become more common, potential employers include companies that can make ready use of automation. This includes companies concerned with home and office automation, entertainment companies and autonomous systems research and development. Autonomous systems and the sophisticated sensors they employ are also adopted in many industries to enhance production and to improve safety (e.g. mining, manufacturing, transport).<br />\n<br />\nThis stream introduces students to the foundations of artificial intelligence and the core technologies (machine learning, knowledge representation) that are required to apply AI in the real world.",

This is a high demand area of employment and is forecast to have serious undersupply of graduates to at least 2025. The cyber security education design is based on the security approaches of Ross Anderson and Bruce Schneier and incorporates an explicit engineering focus to security, rather than the more usual ad hoc &#34;hacker&#34;?, or commercial &#34;responsive&#34;? approaches of cyber security education.<br />\n<br />\nThe core courses in the stream teach analysis and systematic professional approaches to engineering security and examine failures, bugs, and human / system interactions and issues. There is an ongoing focus on security by design and professional ethical security practice.<br />\n<br />\nSpecialist elective courses allow students to specialise in their areas of interest and skill. Graduates of the stream are equipped for careers in penetration testing, incident response, software assessment, malware analysis, forensics, military or law enforcement, security consulting, and security lead in dev teams. This stream relies on students being exposed to C and to secure coding and vulnerabilities in first year including: memory use (data representation, the heap, function calls and the stack), and some assembly.",

This may include artists who are re-entering the education sector, arts professionals looking to augment their career options, or recent BA graduates seeking a higher research program of study including structured coursework and mentoring. The stream will also serve art workers wishing to develop a research practice within their field (eg. education, administration/management, programming/curation, disability arts support, community arts, artist development, producing). Professional artists with an existing practice will develop writing and analytical skills within the course to support their careers in relation to both communications and creative development. An enhanced career in the fields mentioned is a possible outcome, or entry into these competitive fields with the advantage of skills in independent research and analysis. After\u00a0graduating from the course you may go on to doctoral level research and enter academia, or become researchers in industry contexts supporting strategic development of audiences, programming models, or artist resources. You\u00a0will be well equipped to specialise as critics/reviewers and arts journalists, develop niche curatorial projects based on their specialisations, or work in libraries and archives related to the arts.</p>",

The interdisciplinary environment at UNSW will also help you forge links with other areas of creative production such as screen writing, media and performing arts.</p>\n<p>Through workshop-based core courses at each level of the major, you will learn how to generate, draft, revise and edit your own writing, and to locate that writing in the context of both literary history and current literary trends. You will be exposed to new experimental techniques of writing and given the opportunity to reflect on how you want to contribute to literary culture. At the same time you will hone your critical and analytical skills to enable you to appraise and assess both your own work and the work of other writers.</p>\n<p>Prescribed electives at each level are offered to complement your writing with a more formal knowledge of literary genres and movements. The major challenges you to integrate a rigorous critical competency in areas such as poetics and narrative theory into the aesthetic choices you make as a writer. It also challenges you to consider the broader cultural and political implications of those choices and to imagine how you can engage with critical ideas and social debate through and in your own writing. Electives in other disciplines offer the opportunity to extend your writing skills in other media forms and establish formal connections with majors in film studies, media studies, and theatre and performance studies.</p>",

Over the past 50 years, criminology has evolved into a rich, broad-based discipline, no longer narrowly focused on crime and punishment. Contemporary criminological scholars investigate a broad range of topics including justice, conflict, risk, security, insurance, policing, governance and regulation. Criminology is shaped not only by scholars in law, philosophy, psychology and sociology, but also those in history, politics, economics, architecture, cultural studies, and other interdisciplinary fields.<br />\n<br />\nCriminology aims to provide you with a critical and informed understanding of crime and justice issues in contemporary society. At UNSW we use an interdisciplinary approach that integrates disciplinary knowledge from Sociology, Psychology, History, Law and Policy Studies, to provide a critical and theoretically informed understanding of crime and the justice system, criminal law and procedures, criminological research methods, as well as a range of current issues with respect to social control, juvenile justice, human rights, regulation, and penal policy.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>Not only has nearly every organisation become completely dependent on technology, but technology also continues to become more complex. Securing today&#39;s systems, networks and data against cyber attacks is tougher than ever, with even more security technologies and processes needed to work in concert with each other. So, organisations need their cyber workforces to be larger and have a wider range of skills than ever before. With such high demand, the lack of cybersecurity professionals creates potential gaps in security. These gaps can cause everything from irresponsible handling of personal information to catastrophic failures of infrastructure that could have life-and-death consequences.<br /><br />For professionals seeking to transition fields, retain and expand knowledge, and refresh skills, this program provides a foundation in cyber security literacy and background technical knowledge plus applied cyber security units, and provides a security mindset and understanding of the current state of the field. The course offerings are designed in consultation with industry to reflect industry practices and future demands and equip students with a wide range of cyber security skills. Graduates will be able to help organisations protect their data, identify and manage cyber risk, recover from cyber attacks and develop cyber security strategies.\u00a0</p>",

Please refer to previous editions of the\u00a0handbook\u00a0for pre-2024 requirements.</strong></p>\n<p>Database management systems (DBMSs) provide essential infrastructure for handling the large volumes of data required by modern enterprises: corporate, government, scientific and educational. How database systems are applied can critically affect the success of an organisation. In the future, the management of very large volumes of organisational data will be an essential component of the livelihood and growth of every organisation.<br /><br />Since databases are so widely used, potential employers include any organisation that relies on the effective management of data. Obvious examples of large organisations with significant data management needs are financial institutions, telecommunications companies, manufacturing enterprises, and government departments. However, employment is not limited to such organisations, since data management is also critical in medium and small enterprises, such as scientific research labs and small businesses.<br /><br />The Database Systems stream in the Graduate Diploma and Master of Information Technology programs exposes students both to the foundations of DBMS architecture (essential knowledge for database administrators) as well as to the principles behind leading edge applications of databases, such as e-Commerce, data warehousing, and data mining.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES) offers a number of Honours streams including in Ecology. Honours in Ecology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological, ecological and environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project under the close supervision of academic(s) within the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Ecology must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Ecology (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Ecology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline: <strong>Please note</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Biologyreceive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Students learn and put into practice the skills needed to conduct an independent and original research project and to communicate and defend the results of the research. Graduates with an Honours degree from the School of Economics at UNSW have moved on to successful careers in both the public and private sectors and academia.<br />\n<br />\nThe Economics Honours program is designed for students with the equivalent of a BEc degree with a major in Economics or Econometrics or an economics major in another program.There are prerequisite courses for the Economics Honours degree that must have completed prior to their Honours year.<br />\n<br />\nTo satisfy the Honours requirements, students complete an additional year of study, including Honours level courses (both compulsory and elective) and a research thesis in economics. Full-time and part-time (during 3 semesters) study is available in this program. Mid-year entry to the BEc(Hons) is possible, but is typically recommended only for part-time study.",

Flexibility and choice are maintained throughout the entire structure by providing many elective courses.<br />\n<br />\nEnvironmental engineers are concerned with the environmental impact of engineering activities. They apply their broad knowledge of engineering and environmental processes in identifying environmental problems and in developing effective solutions to them. They also coordinate the activities of specialist groups such as biologists, ecologists and geologists within major projects. The discipline of environmental engineering embraces parts of civil engineering, with emphasis on management, systems design, water, geotechnical and transport engineering, together with aspects of chemical engineering, applied and biological sciences and environmental studies.<br />\n<br />\nThis stream can be taken on a four-year full-time basis or on a part-time basis subject to the approval of the Head of School. Intending part-time students are advised that all courses are offered only in the daytime.<br />\n<br />\nA detailed stream structure can be found on the School website, which includes suggested scheduling of courses by semester. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.",

Honours in Environmental Management introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the biological, ecological and environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project\u00a0 under the close supervision of academics in the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>\n",

Entry is also possible for students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Environmental Management must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Environmental Management (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weighted average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Environmental Management stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the BEES Honours Program webpage (<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours</a>). It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via UNSW Research (<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">research.unsw.edu.au</a>). Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Environmental Management receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

The most well-known examples are payment systems (PayPal, WeChat, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency), portfolio management and Robo-advice (US, Europe, Australia), peer-to-peer lending (US, China, India and elsewhere), high-frequency trading (global), and decentralized finance (of which Bitcoin and cryptocurrency form the foundation). Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.</p>\n\n<p>Parallel to elevating students\u2019 finance knowledge and skills via MFIN courses, the Financial Technology specialisation, co-developed with financial services industry experts, explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. Students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab): gaining personal access to financial market data platforms, handling financial market and unstructured data, learning how financial products work via the Python programming language, trading using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interacting with practitioners.</p>\n",

Established financial services firms (BigTech) and entrepreneurs (FinTech) both demand talent in this space as FinTech products are by nature scalable and have potential for huge impact in a financial services business.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Co-developed with financial services industry experts, this major introduces students to finance theory, financial products, markets, and institutions, then explores how big data and other technologies allow FinTech start-ups to cause consumers to shift away from traditional finance - fundamentally changing the way money is raised, transferred, stored, loaned, and invested around the world. In addition to a conceptual understanding of finance theory, financial markets, and financial services firms, students will experience FinTech courses via the Integrated Learning Laboratory (iLab). They will be able to gain personal access to financial market data platforms, handle financial market and unstructured data, learn how financial products work via the Python programming language, trade using the leading stock trading platform used by brokerage firms, and interact with practitioners.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The Bachelor of Commerce (Financial Technology) major can be taken standalone or be taken to complement other streams of studies such as finance, information system, computer science, engineering, law, and more.

You will have the opportunity to apply yourself to the areas of food science, safety, nutrition and health, product design and enquiry projects, professional food practice, food systems management and conduct research towards your thesis project.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Food Science and Nutrition stream will build your knowledge of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms\u202funderlying metabolism, health and disease.\u00a0We emphasise the links between food and health through hands-on laboratory courses and visits to several food industries to observe mass-scale production and the processes involved. Through this, you\u2019ll understand how processes can be used to preserve nutrients in food and how nutrients can be added for food fortification, for example. The product design and development project offers an authentic design experience which integrates industry involvement, case studies, IP and product development. It\u2019s a real-world opportunity for you to understand and apply the process from conception to development.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The Food Science degree provides an opportunity to also do an optional minor in Humanitarian Science and Technology that focuses on applying the Food Science knowledge towards achieving the UN Sustainable development goals.\u00a0</p>",

        "description": "<p>The major in French Studies enables students to study French at a number of levels in order to attain proficiency. Courses are offered from the introductory level to the advanced and professional levels. Students not only develop their knowledge of the French language, but also gain intercultural awareness and understanding of the French-speaking world. They study cultures, communities, societies and literature in France and the Francophone world. The French language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken. Learning French will provide students with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in other countries. Developing competence in French will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n\n<p>There are two main components of language study. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other people&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the French language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of French and Francophone cultures. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the French language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n\n<ol><li>to foster understanding of the experiences and world-views of French and Francophone cultures;</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies where French is spoken;</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis-\u00e0\u00a0-vis French and Francophone societies and cultures;</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about French and Francophone societies, cultures, and the arts;</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate.</li></ol>\n\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For students admitted in their first year of study to ARTS2480 or higher on the grounds of ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as Level 1 courses in terms of degree requirements.</p>\n",

By approaching gender from historical, theoretical, cross-cultural and First Nations perspectives, and in relation to other categories such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, class and disability, we will equip you with the skills and knowledge to apply intersectional gender analysis to a wide range of academic, professional and community contexts. Gender studies is outward-looking, politically engaged and theoretically innovative: we aim to make this an area of study that has the capacity to help you explain the world and perhaps even to help change it.</p>",

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Genetics can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Genetics is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (t1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3)\u00a0 Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours (16UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors.

These changes, among many others, at their most fundamental are about social and environmental dynamics and their relationship across space and time.

Honours in Geography introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical and social environmental sciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which includes a literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial an independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics within the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Geography stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a>\u00a0webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via\u00a0<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline.\u00a0<strong>Please note:</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Geography receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES) offers a number of Honours streams including in Geology. Honours in Geology introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the earth sciences and geosciences. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this Program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The Program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and an independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics in the school of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours in Geology must have satisfied the minimum requirements of a three year Bachelor degree in Geology (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Geology stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a>\u00a0webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via\u00a0<a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline:\u00a0<strong>Please note</strong>\u00a0that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program in Geology receive some Advanced Standing in the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a>\u00a0(Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

        "description": "As the demand for energy increases globally, the need for new sources of energy becomes more important. Sustainable forms of energy are of priority in the modern world. Geothermal energy is one of the sustainable forms energy where the heat energy generated and stored in Earth are applied. More than 90 countries in the world have proven Geothermal energy resources. Recently, there has been significant investment in this resource globally. Australia and New Zealand also have enormous Geothermal resources. The exploitation of these resources has a large overlap with Petroleum Engineering methods including reservoir characterization and drilling methods. However, there is a need for extra research for the familiarity of students with these resources at an advanced level.<br />\n<br />\nFurther, today&#39;s leaders in energy disciplines need to be able to move from the existing body of knowledge in the profession to develop new and innovative solutions to problems covering the technical aspects of earth exploration and development, to project economics, and to the environmental and social context of the industry. Therefore, the stream includes a range of courses with a research or enquiry-based learning component. These enquiry-based components involve students solving an open-ended problem through the integration of taught material with their own investigation into the problem and developing their own solutions.",

However, anatomy today is much more than the descriptive study of the dissected body, although dissected specimens, along with immersive technologies such as virtual reality, are used for research and instruction. The study of anatomy now embraces separate but strongly related disciplines: gross anatomy deals with the description of form, arrangement and function of the bones, joints, muscles and internal organs, together with their blood and nerve supply; histology deals with the microscopic structure of tissues and cells; embryology is concerned with the normal development of the embryo and fetus from conception to birth and with the mechanisms of development and malformations; neuroanatomy deals with the internal organisation and functions of the brain and spinal cord; biological anthropology involves applying biological principles and approaches to the study of humans &amp; non-human primates.</p>\n<p>We are ranked 41 (2020) in the world for anatomy and physiology. At UNSW, all anatomy courses have a strong emphasis on living anatomy with functional and clinical significance of the structures in health and in disease. Anatomy is also applied to related disciplines of biomedical engineering, medical imaging and diagnostic technology, and the virtual and augmented reality.</p>\n<p>Careers in anatomy include medicine, medical research, neuroscience, reproductive technologies (IVF) and allied health disciplines such as Physiotherapy and Exercise Physiology. You could pursue a career as a radiographer forensic anthropologist, immersive (VR, AR) developer, and a data specialist. Studying anatomy also prepares students well for careers in medicine and is especially relevant clinical skills, surgery and radiological imaging.</p>\n<p>Anatomy may be combined with elective courses in Biochemistry, Physiology, Microbiology, Pathology or Psychology.</p>",

Students become familiar with examining macroscopic specimens of diseased tissue, microscopic differences between normal and abnormal cells, tissues and organs as well as interpretation of basic diagnostic laboratory investigations and imaging. Much of the study of microscopic abnormalities is undertaken using computer-based &#39;virtual&#39; microscopy. Students also become familiar with the molecular mechanisms that underlie the development of disease.

In this way you will be drawn into an awareness of Indigenous knowledge and tradition as an organiser of Indigenous worlds and continuing Indigenous practices. This alerts you to your prior assumptions, positions the contests that occur within Indigenous Studies, and prepares you for deeper intellectual inquiry at levels two and three.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major culminates in a capstone course, where you will practice navigating a range of issues potentially encountered in the workplace. Understanding Indigenous knowledge and practice, and the historical relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia are required for comprehension of the complex mix of continuities, ruptures and convergences that condition the contemporary Indigenous position and how it can be understood.</p>\n<p>The Indigenous Studies Major is designed for those of you seeking to specialise in Indigenous Studies as the central focus of your degree program.

Studying International Political Economy (IPE) enables you to come to grips with some of the most pressing questions in and of global politics today. You will enquire into the nature of both global and local relations of economic power, including how they are sustained by shifting patterns of knowledge and authority. You will examine the features and dynamics of forces such as capitalism, globalisation, neo- and postcolonialism, and will investigate the histories, knowledges and roles of particular actors, ideas, agendas and experiences. You will explore the fault lines created by global integration, economic crisis and deepening social, political and economic inequality. As you develop your ideas and build a personal, and always political, sense of how politics shapes economics, and vice versa, you will participate directly in the evolving relationship between theory, practice and policymaking.</p>",

Please refer to previous editions of the\u00a0handbook\u00a0for pre-2024 requirements.</strong></p>\n<p>The internet is a collection of separate physical networks, interconnected by a common protocol, to form a single logical network. The internet is the substrate and chief communications backbone for the world wide web that provides for the flow of data between applications that may be geographically distributed. How can a network operator guarantee that its resources are utilised properly? How can the network guarantee that the users and applications receive a desired level of service? Are there better ways of designing/implementing protocols for communications? These non-trivial problems must be solved for successful internetworking.<br /><br />The Internetworking specialisation is suitable for graduates with an interest in the field of networking. The specialisation prepares graduates for employment as network engineers, telecommunication and network software developers, research scientists, network administrators.<br /><br />The Internetworking specialisation exposes students to the building blocks of the internet, routing algorithms and switching techniques for new networking requirements with an emphasis on the next generation of internet architectures and protocols. Students will develop skills in performance analysis and capacity planning to cope with projected higher loads.</p>",

Through provisions of Australia-Japan contact situations, students gain intercultural awareness and understanding, develop their knowledge of the language, cultures, societies and communities in Japan. The Japanese language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of Japan. Japan is of increasing fundamental importance to Australia for political, strategic and economic reasons in realisation of Australia in the Asian Century. Thus, learning Japanese and developing competence in Japanese will provide students a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Japan and beyond, take an important role in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n<p>Aims of the Major</p>\n<p>There are two main components of Japanese Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the target language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Japanese language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Japanese culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social productions. Via the study of the Japanese language and associated disciplines, we aim:</p>\n<ol><li>to foster an awareness of Japan&#39;s culture, history and society,</li><li>to develop informed understanding of human experiences, cultures, and societies in Japan,</li><li>to enable students to place contemporary Australian society and culture in an historical and comparative context vis a vis Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to develop the skills of critical, creative, and imaginative thinking about Japanese culture and society,</li><li>to promote the techniques and value of reasoned and open-minded discussion and debate,</li><li>to nurture positive attitudes toward intercultural communication in general and with the Japanese,</li><li>to promote learner autonomy.</li></ol>\n<p>This stream is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Placement Information</strong></p>\n<p>Students who wish to enrol in a language course without completing the necessary prerequisites are required to complete an online placement application form before the commencement of the term.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/arts-design-architecture/our-schools/humanities-languages/student-life/resources-support/language-placements#:~:text&#61;If%20you%27ve%20had%20experience,UNSW%20for%20the%20first%20time\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Website</a>.</p>\n<p>For students admitted in their first year of study to ARTS2630 or higher on the grounds of ability and/or previous study, such courses will be counted as entry level courses in terms of degree requirements.</p>",

It provides you with the opportunity to develop as a competent user of the Korean language. You will gain intercultural awareness and understanding, develop explicit knowledge of language, and gain knowledge of the social, cultural and historical background of Korean-speaking people. The Korean language plays a key role in expressing the cultures and identities of the places in which it is spoken.</p>\n<p>Learning Korean will provide you with a privileged form of access to the cultural resources and complex patterns of life in Korea and other countries. Developing competence in Korean will have an important place in promoting relationships and mutual understanding between countries and peoples.</p>\n<p>There are two main components of Korean Studies. The first is a focus on the acquisition of competence in the Korean language. Acquiring target language competence involves a wide range of knowledge and understanding of sociocultural conventions as well as skills in self-expression, both oral and written, and skills in comprehending other&#39;s expression, both oral and written. The second component is the study of aspects of the cultures and societies associated with the Korean language. We draw upon other disciplines in order to inform understanding of Korean culture. These disciplines include linguistic, literary, cultural, historical and social studies.</p>\n<p>This specialisation is available to students commencing at Introductory and Intermediate entry levels.</p>",

What is the biological basis for language? Is language unique to the human species? How and why do languages change? How do children learn language? What is the meaning of &#39;meaning&#39;? Can machines talk? How does language relate to other modes of communication?

Honours in Marine Science introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical, environmental and ecological sciences with an emphasis on marine, aquatic and coastal environments. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their \u2018role as a researcher\u2019 to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three terms, includes a Research Proposal (which includes an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial and partly independent Research Project. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines or programs at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours Program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours program are final.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Marine Science stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> that this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">8623 Masters of Environmental Management</a> and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

If you plan to graduate with this specialisation in 2021, please contact the School Office for more information.</p>\n<p>This entry lists professional electives for a major in Functional Materials within a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Materials Science and Engineering.<br /><br />Functional materials are those which possess highly specific native properties and functions, such as ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, magnetism and energy storage.<br /><br />This stream is intended to offer a strong undergraduate training in the field of functional materials. They are found in all classes of materials: metals, ceramics, polymers, and organic molecules. Functional materials show great promise for many strategic technological advances that will change the way in which materials are used. Typical applications include devices for electromagnetic applications, energy generation, electro- and magneto- caloric materials for energy storage, solar harvesting functions, and semiconductor logic and memory technology.<br /><br />Functional Materials are introduced comprehensively in Stages 3 and 4 by a number of professional electives. Students also undertake a materials design project and a substantial thesis project. Students may complete the first one or two years of their degree at their local university engineering school and then transfer with advanced standing to UNSW.</p>",

Work by pure mathematicians underpins most of the technological advances of this century. Pure Mathematics is concerned with problems and techniques which transcend specific applications. Research, focusing on the development of existing theories or the creation of new ones, may be driven by applications or by the internal demands of the discipline. Pure Mathematics courses provide the insights and understanding required by those using mathematics, leading to mastery of the fundamental processes of mathematical science and the capacity for innovative applications in any area.</p>\n\n<p><em>Applied Mathematics</em> concerns the development of mathematics and models for understanding scientific phenomena, for the solution of technical and industrial problems, and for use in the social, economic and management sciences. Courses are designed to provide basic mathematical and computational skills needed for a wide range of applications, to develop the capability to construct, analyse and interpret mathematical models, and to encourage enthusiasm for the role of the mathematician in a variety of contexts.</p>\n\n<p><em>Statistics</em> is the science and art of using factual material for modelling and inference. Its mathematical foundations are in the theory of probability and it deals with how to estimate and make decisions using knowledge which is uncertain or observational material which is subject to error. There is a rich interplay of ideas between the theory of statistics and fields such as engineering, medicine and biological and behavioural sciences where statistical problems constantly arise.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for a major in Mathematics for Education as part of a concurrent Bachelor of Science / Bachelor of Education program (4076). Only students enrolled concurrently in both a Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Education program may take this major. The major ensures that students meet all accreditation requirements with the NSW Institute of Teachers.</p>\n",

        "description": "The Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream is designed for students with a mechanical engineering major whose interests also lie in realising, commercialising and implementing mechanical and mechatronic systems and designs. The five core courses included as part of this stream have been designed on the basis of world best practice in manufacturing and industrial engineering and reflect a top-down - bottom-up approach, spanning the disciplines of Strategy and Management, Operations and Supply Chains, Analysis and Decision-making, Design of Product-Process Systems and Technology &amp; Automation.<br />\n<br />\nWithin each discipline area this new stream will cover many conceptual and analytical techniques, all supporting fact- and data-based analysis and decision making with the aim of improved product and process performance, economy and sustainability. This stream is designed to help you to learn how to transform a design from a conceptual stage into a prototype and ultimately into a commercially realisable and viable product. This stream focuses on technical as well as commercial aspects and particularly in developing the ability to build a business or commercial case for making engineering related decisions, such as investment in plant, equipment and processes. Although the main emphasis will be on product and process, consideration will also be given to designing compatible and appropriate engineering support services. The stream also emphasises the strategic impact of operations decisions and the interfaces between operations and the other functional areas of organisations, including of course, finance. This stream encompasses the key elements of operations management and investment analysis and pulls them together in a coherent format that allows you to understand the &#39;big picture&#39; as well as &#39;the specific details&#39;. It is aimed at integrating the knowledge gained from the mechanical engineering courses you have studied into a framework and process that allows you to implement your designs, solutions and ideas in a commercial environment.<br />\n<br />\nMechanical engineers have traditionally played the major role in the analysis and design of complex machinery, devices such as actuators and sensors, as well as energy transformation, heat transfer and electro-mechanical processes. In an environment of global competition, sustainability (energy, environment as well as cost and capital), increasingly complex customer requirements and statutory regulations as well as the increasing pace of technological change and new product innovation, it is vital for modern engineers to possess the skills to not only design but equally importantly, implement and realize their designs in the most appropriate way. In this increasingly complex environment, successful organizations - public, private or governmental - need engineers with analytical and diverse skills, especially in integrating technical with commercial and organisational issues, analyses and ultimately solutions. It is the purpose and aim of the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering stream to equip you with this knowledge and understanding to become a global engineer, indeed a leader, with the ability to apply analytical methods and quality processes to create short and long term value for your organization, your customers, and the community. It encapsulates the key elements of mechanical engineering and combines them with the five core disciplines of manufacturing and industrial engineering.<br />\n<br />\nAn engineer trained in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering may be employed in a very flexible and diverse range of disciplines and areas of industrial activity, including; product design, process design, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, quality improvement, technical and commercial analysis and decision making, strategic decision making, consulting, sales support, technical and organisational maintenance, and supply chain management.",

Indeed, microorganisms are the key participants for the turnover of nutrients and elements and they are the main producers of organic carbon and biomass. They turn the biological wheels on this globe and are responsible for sustainability of life. They also contribute to a better environment via recycling of organic wastes, maintenance of soil fertility and biodegradation of pollutants. Many foodstuffs, beverages, pharmaceuticals and other products of biotechnology are products of microbial action.

Physiology contributes to all major aspects of human biology and the allied disciplines of pharmacology, anatomy and pathology.<br /><br />A major in Medical Physiology is only available to students enrolled in the Bachelor of Medical Science program.</p>",

Class II, Division 2 (65% to 74%)</em><br />\nWork of good quality in research, writing and presentation but with some significant errors or/and deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><em>Hons. Class III (50% to 64%)</em><br />\nWork is in acceptable form and demonstrates basic research, writing and presentation skills. The work has several significant deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p><em>Fail (&lt;50%)</em><br />\nWork has a number of major flaws and there is evidence of lack of basic knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be reviewed by at least two internal reviewers other than the supervisor(s). A panel will then determine the allocation of final honours grade.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>Admission to Honours is competitive, and depends on academic merit as well as the availability of an approved supervisor. Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM of lower than 65/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Admission Process</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about staff research interests and the process of applying for Honours can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours-mphil-babs</a>, and appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS website</a>. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">the School of BABS website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Microbiology may find employment in research, government and industry. Past graduates of honours in Microbiology have found employment in all of the above sectors.</p>\n",

After graduation, mining engineers who choose to develop careers in operations management gain further practical experience to obtain a Mine Manager&#39;s Certificate of Competency, in either Coal or Metalliferous Mining.

The BABS BSc (Hons) Degree provides an opportunity for students to experience hands-on scientific research. Honours students become part of a research team within one of the research labs in the School, and complete a supervised research project and thesis during the year-long program.</p>\n\n<p>A key benefit of the Honours year is that it provides for a different type of learning experience. It proceeds at the pace of the individual student, with suitable supervisory oversight providing relevant training in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Honours is also an opportunity for the student to undertake measured and reflective decision making about their future scientific career. Examples of recent projects and further information regarding Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students/honours-mphil-projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honours and MPhil Projects</a> page on the BABS website.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Molecular and Cell Biology is to be completed full-time. Students commence their enrolment in Term 1 (T1) or Term 2 (T2) or Term 3 (T3). Students should check with the undergraduate school administrator and honours coordinator for current enrolment deadlines and completion dates.</p>\n\n<p>Students must enrol in BABS4516 BABS Honours\u00a0 (16 UOC) for three terms.</p>\n\n<p>The program involves a research project that forms the majority of the assessment. The project, although supervised, is to be completed with substantial independence and self-direction. In addition, the program involves a series of student consultations, tutorials and seminars. Students should seek to meet with other School researchers and academics to stimulate research ideas and aid the research process. Honours Students must attend a series of compulsory workshops on ethics, research design, data analysis, thesis writing, presentation skills and publishing (see Assessment below).</p>\n",

Consideration of academic merit is focused on performance in third level Science subjects and overall WAM, and students must meet all requirements of their undergraduate degree (stages 1 to 3) before being considered eligible.</p>\n\n<p>Students with an average overall WAM lower than 65 and/or an average of lower than 65 in third-level Science courses will usually not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>Students who have achieved an average overall WAM of 65 or higher and an average of 65 or higher in third-level Science courses may be admitted if an approved supervisor is available.</p>\n\n<p>The major of a current BABS undergraduate student will normally determine their Honours category, but there is some flexibility depending on the student\u2019s interests and availability of supervisors. UNSW Medical Science students (3991 program) and graduates from other Australian or overseas universities are welcome to apply for the BABS Honours program. Their selected research project will determine the Honours area in which they enrol.</p>\n\n<p><em>Process</em></p>\n\n<p>Students who meet the entry requirements, or expect to do so, should make contact with potential supervisors. Further information about the process of applying for Honours can be found here <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/how-apply-honours</a>, and other appropriate links on the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au/future_students/future-honours-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website. Following this, students should contact undergraduate student office and complete an honours application form before the due date (typically February for S1 and June for S2).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students with successful honours may be qualified to enrol in postgraduate level studies (Master of Philosophy, Master of Science by research or Ph.D.), depending on the level of honours obtained and the area in which research is to be undertaken. Further information can be gained from the <a href=\"http://www.babs.unsw.edu.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">School of BABS</a> website.</p>\n\n<p>Graduates of honours degree in Molecular and Cell Biology may find employment in research, government and industry.

These advances have opened up the exciting field of Molecular Biology, one of the most rapid growth areas in biology. This marriage of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Cell Biology provides an exciting new approach for the study of all living organisms, including the human. Molecular Biology therefore represents fundamental components of biological and medical science and they will have increasingly important roles to play in many aspects of modern medicine, genetics, evolutionary biology, bioinformatics, biotechnology and genomics. This Molecular and Cell Biology major offers a general introduction to the discipline during the first years of study and then allows students to diversify into the more specialised areas in later years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

Furthermore, understanding of this amazing and complex organ can shed light not only on understanding our how our body organs are controlled, and how our responses to different external stimuli, but can also shed light on how prior experiences impact on these organ and body responses. Indeed, the complex processes that the brain uses to integrate different stimuli with prior experiences can also lead to new technologies and approaches to benefit society.\u00a0\u00a0 Neuroscience is a cross-disciplinary topic and the program introduces you to this study of the biology of the brain and how neural activity results in specific behaviours through different disciplines of Physiology, Psychology, Anatomy and Pharmacology. The flexibility of different subject options within the Program reflects this cross-disciplinary input into studying Brain and behaviour.\n\n\n",

In parallel, growth will also be required in the non-defence nuclear supply chain, including but not limited to safeguards regulators, safety regulators, manufacturing and engineering consulting. Engineering graduates with some exposure to nuclear knowledge, as provided by a Minor program, are already in high demand, in this growing sector.</p>\n<p>The Nuclear Engineering Minor aims to provide undergraduate students with a foundation in nuclear engineering, in preparation for entering the nuclear workforce. The Minor encourages you to combine skills learnt from traditional engineering disciplines with specialist knowledge to solve the challenges facing nuclear technology. You will become nuclear-conversant, learn the underlying theory behind nuclear engineering techniques, explore the role of nuclear energy in a low-carbon future and gain an appreciation for the investigation and enforcement of regulations.</p>\n<p>The 24 UOC of courses required for the Minor can be course shared with courses taken for other program requirements.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Completion of the minor will require the choice of ENGG3741 as a discipline elective (or breadth elective for ELECAH3707 and CEICAH3707) within their major stream.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Students completing the following majors can complete the minor within their program requirements:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Aerospace\u200b Engineering \u00a0</li><li>Chemical\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Chemical Product\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Civil\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Environmental\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Electrical Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mechanical\u200b Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mechatronic Engineering\u00a0\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>Students completing the following majors cannot complete the minor within their program requirements:\u00a0</p>\n<ul><li>Bioinformatics\u00a0</li><li>Computer Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Mining Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Petroleum Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Photovoltaics and Solar Energy\u00a0</li><li>Quantum Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Renewable Energy Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Software Engineering\u00a0</li><li>Surveying\u00a0</li><li>Telecommunications\u00a0</li></ul>\n<p>The minor will not be available to students in double degrees.\u00a0</p>",

Please refer to previous editions of the\u00a0handbook\u00a0for pre-2024 requirements.</strong></p>\n<p>The nuclear debate is ongoing. Irrespective of the outcome of &#39;new build&#39; proposals in the Western world, there is an existing portfolio of reactors that require maintenance, servicing, operation and eventually decommissioning. There is waste to be managed and there is a fuel cycle that requires servicing and handling. They all necessitate engineers with an understanding of the unique environment experienced at nuclear sites.</p>\n<p>In addition, many countries are assessing nuclear energy programmes as one of a number of mechanisms to provide secure, low-carbon energy, and some have embarked on national nuclear build programmes. Such programmes are raising many global challenges, not least due to proliferation concerns and environmental security.</p>\n<p>The long-term needs of the nuclear engineering field are clear and many nations have long-term commitments to nuclear engineering including conventional power generation, radiological applications in medicine and healthcare, and proliferation monitoring and control. There is an ageing workforce in the sector and ample opportunities for nuclear engineering graduates.</p>\n<p>Hence there is a strong need for a new generation of nuclear-conversant engineers. The development of nuclear engineering skills is a timely opportunity for engineering graduates. The aim of the Nuclear Engineering stream is to educate and inform engineering graduates in the underpinning theory behind nuclear engineering techniques, technologies and processes, and provides a stream that allows engineering graduates, from traditional engineering disciplines, to prepare themselves for a career in nuclear engineering. The stream aims to produce graduates capable of embarking on a nuclear engineering career and contributing to the nuclear debate from a knowledgeable standpoint.</p>\n<p>The specilisation will have contributions from national and international experts in the Nuclear Engineering sector including staff from the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College, London, and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) in Australia.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences (BEES) offers a number of Honours streams including Palaeoscience. Honours in Palaeoscience introduces undergraduate students to research and project work of relevance to various endeavours in the physical environmental sciences including archaeology, evolutionary anthropology, palaeoclimate, palaeoecology, palaeontology and past human environmental interactions and hazards. Students undertake a supervised research project that places emphasis on scientific research methods, the use of relevant specialised techniques, critical thinking and scientific communication via written submissions and oral presentations. The learning and teaching philosophy underpinning this program is centred on Honours students taking on their role as a researcher to develop these skills and the relevant advanced disciplinary knowledge with some degree of independence. The program, run over three sessions, includes a Research Proposal (which may include an extended literature review and a risk management component) and a substantial independent Research Project under the close supervision of academics within the School of BEES. These components are complemented by more formal seminars and workshops, focusing on graduate attributes (scientific communication, risk management, ethics and professional development) as well as School (and Institute/Centre) seminars.</p>",

The Honours program begins with a graded Research Proposal which includes an extended literature review and risk management component. This is supplemented with the Research Project which is described in a submitted manuscript (the majority of the assessment) and by a final seminar. These components are complemented by a series of ungraded but compulsory elements which include workshops on risk management, ethics and professional development. Students in Honours are also required to attend a minimum number of School seminars during their enrolment.</p>\n<p>Students must enrol in BEES4517 (16UoC) in Term 1, Term 2 and Term 3.\u00a0 BEES does not offer part-time Honours enrolment.</p>\n<p>The Honours Stream in Palaeoscience has the following assessment items:</p>\n<p><strong>Research Proposal</strong></p>\n<p>A 4500 word (max. length) written Research Proposal providing a detailed account of published scientific investigations relevant to the project being undertaken and a Risk Management component. This component is completed\u00a0under the direction of a duly appointed Honours Supervisor. This Research Proposal is graded by two independent Examiners and forms 12.5% of the total Honours Grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Thesis</strong></p>\n<p>This component is completed\u00a0under the direction of a duly appointed Honours Supervisor. This project works towards the completion of a written manuscript summarising the research and results of the Research Project. This manuscript is a maximum of 8,000 words and is marked by the two assigned Examiners. This component contributes 82.5% to the final Honours Grade.</p>\n<p><strong>Final Seminar</strong></p>\n<p>A 20 minute presentation covering the results of the Research Project. This seminar is assessed by members of the School of BEES Honours Committee and is worth 5% of the total Honours Grade.</p>\n<p>There are other compulsory activities which do not contribute to an Honours Grade but are required for the successful completion of the Honours Program in the School of BEES. This includes:</p>\n<ul><li>Attendance at Honours Program classes which includes a Peer Reviewed Introductory Seminar;</li><li>Submission of a Problem Statement (staff graded);</li><li>Attendance at a Risk Management Workshop, an Ethics Workshop and Professional Development Workshops;</li><li>Attendance at School seminars.</li></ul>\n<p><strong><em>Honours Grade Calculation</em></strong></p>\n<ul><li>Research Proposal - 12.5%</li><li>Project Thesis/Manuscript - 82.5%</li><li>Final Seminar - 5%</li></ul>\n<p>A guide to allocation of Honours classes and what is expected of students within the School of BEES is as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Honours Grade &gt;85 (Honours Class 1):</em><br />Work of superior quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, demonstrating the ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, the integration of information from a wide range of sources and containing clear examples of excellent critical evaluation.</p>\n<p><em>Honours Grade 75-84 (Honours Class 2.1):</em><br />Work of very good quality in all aspects of research, scientific writing, and oral presentation, but showing lesser ability to organise information in a clear and concise manner, integrate information from range of sources and critically evaluate the literature and research data.</p>\n<p><em>Honours Grade 65-74 (Honours Class 2.2):</em><br />Good quality in all aspects research, scientific writing, and oral presentation but with inadequacies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.</p>\n<p><em>Honours Grade 50-64 (Honours Class 3):</em><br />Adequate quality work with significant deficiencies in understanding, critical skills, organisation and presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Admission Requirements and Process</strong></p>\n<p><em>Admission Requirements</em></p>\n<p>The BEES Palaeoscience Honours Program is available to all students whom have met the entry requirements outlined below and is typically offered to Bachelor of Science (3970) and Bachelor of Science (Environmental Management) (3965) students whom have completed a relevant Major sequence. Entry is also possible to students from other cognate disciplines at the discretion of the Program Convener or the School of BEES Honours Coordinator. External students are welcome into all School of BEES Honours Programs but require approval of the Honours Coordinator and will require evidence of the completion of equivalent study.</p>\n<p>Students seeking to enrol in Honours are required to have completed a total of 144 units of credit and all the requirements for the Bachelor of Science (or equivalent). Admission into the BEES Honours Program is subject to academic performance and the number of places available in the School&#39;s Honours Program. Typically students require a Credit average (\u226565% weight average mark; WAM) in their undergraduate degree for entry into Honours. Where students have an overall WAM that is less than, but close to a Credit, the School of BEES may take into consideration a student&#39;s academic performance in their Major area of study when assessing an application for Honours.</p>\n<p>Students must apply to the School of BEES for admission to enrol in the Honours program: admission requirements and the number of places available are determined by the Head of School or nominee and are subject to the availability of resources. All decisions regarding admission to the School of BEES Honours Program are final.</p>\n<p><em>Admission Process</em></p>\n<p>Potential students must first apply for acceptance into the School of BEES Honours Program and into the Palaeoscience stream and, following receipt of an offer of acceptance, students can proceed with enrolment. Application and Enrolment procedures are described on the <a href=\"http://www.bees.unsw.edu.au/current/honours\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEES Honours Program</a> webpage. It is highly recommended that students approach possible Honours Supervisors well before the deadlines to discuss potential Research Projects: supervisors and potential projects can also be found on the BEES Honours webpage. Students may also identify potential supervisors and projects via <a href=\"http://research.unsw.edu.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">UNSW Research</a>. Students should then download and complete an application form and submit it to the BSB Student Office before the submission deadline. <strong>Please note:</strong> this application must include an offer to supervise the Research Project as is detailed in the application form. Students accepted into the Program will receive an offer of acceptance letter from the Honours Coordinator, and can then proceed with full enrolment.</p>\n<p><strong>Pathways</strong></p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the School of BEES Honours Program in Geography are qualified to continue further in their research careers by undertaking postgraduate studies by research (Masters or PhD level). Students who successfully complete the BEES Honours Program receive some Advanced Standing in the <a href=\"https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/programs/current/8623.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Master of Environmental Management</a> (Program 8623) and students achieving a high Honours Grade (Class 1 or 2.1) may apply for an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) PhD scholarship to support such studies.</p>\n<p>Graduates of the BEES Honours Program are also well qualified to work in various endeavours. Past graduates have found employment in the private sector (e.g. resource and environmental management companies, environmental consultancies etc.) and in the public sector (local, state or federal government agencies and regulatory bodies). Potential careers are very broad as the generic skills acquired during an Honours year are widely applicable and highly sought after: in particular Honours students are equipped with advanced disciplinary knowledge, project design and management skills, consideration of Occupational Health and Safety issues and advanced (written and verbal) communication skills.</p>",

Pharmacology is the science that examines the effect of drugs on biological systems, from understanding the molecular level interactions by which drugs work, through to their effects in people. Pharmacologists research and develop new drugs, improve our understanding of how drugs work, identify those that could most benefit from a given drug, and make sure drugs are effective and safe. There are a huge range of potential career pathways for pharmacologists, including academic science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry roles, medical science roles, and regulatory administration. Pharmacologists are therefore at the forefront of modern medicine, allowing us to fight diseases safely and effectively.</p>",

Emphasis is placed on gaining hands-on experience of working with solar energy devices, modules and systems.<br />\n<br />\nInnovative teaching techniques have been developed to enhance the learning environment including the &#39;Virtual Production Line&#39; and &#39;Virtual World Solar Car Challenge&#39;. UNSW academics in the photovoltaic field have been consistently ranked amongst the leaders worldwide through international peer review. This team has held the world record for silicon solar cell efficiencies for decades and were responsible for developing the most successfully commercialized new photovoltaic technology internationally throughout the same period. From 2006 onwards we have seen an explosion of interest in the School&#39;s technologies from major industry players all around the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Second Area of Specialisation</strong></p>\n\n<p>The cross-disciplinary nature of photovoltaics and renewable energy applications necessitates many PV engineers possessing broad engineering backgrounds or else working in teams with other engineers. A good example is the UNSW Solar Car Project involving PV engineers, electronics engineers, control engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, power engineers, biomedical engineers, computer engineers, and communication engineers. Therefore it is important for photovoltaic engineers to have a broader understanding of other engineering disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>A unique feature of this stream is that in Year 2, students have the opportunity to select a strand to complement their education in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy. Each strand comprises 18 units of credit with the opportunity to subsequently select additional electives in the corresponding area in the final two years, subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator. The strands available are listed below and cover areas such as computing, electronics, mathematics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, physics, chemical engineering, and architecture. Students may also formulate their own strands subject to the approval of the Undergraduate Coordinator.</p>\n\n<p>Selection of a second area of specialisation is subject to the stream rule that states that no more than 60 UOC of first-year level courses may be counted toward the BE (Hons) in Photovoltaics and Solar Energy.</p>\n\n<p>Photovoltaics and Solar Energy is also available as a component of the dual degree programs.</p>\n",

It requires studying higher-level coursework and completion of an independent research project, under the guidance of an academic supervisor. The Honours year commences in Term 1 and is undertaken full-time over 1 year. Term 3 entry may also be available. Part-time enrolment, commencing Term 1 only, may be available.</p>\n\n<p>Students complete 24 UOC of coursework by enrolling in PHYS4141 Quantum Mechanics (Honours) 6 UOC and PHYS4142 Statistical Physics (Honours) 6 UOC in Term 1, and PHYS4143 Topics in Contemporary Physics 12 UOC in Term 2. The Term 1 courses are assessed via assignments worth 40% and exams worth 60% of the final mark. In PHYS4143 students will take two of the four lecture modules offered in modern physics. These are assessed via a presentation (10%), assignments (30%) and final exam (60%). Coursework contributes 50% towards a student\u2019s final grade for honours.</p>\n\n<p>The other 50% of a Physics honours mark comes from completion of an original research project, conducted over three terms. Students complete 24 UOC of research by enrolling in PHYS4144 Physics Honours Research A 6 UOC in Term 1, PHYS4145 Physics Honours Research B 6 UOC in Term 2 and PHYS4146 Physics Honours Research C 12 UOC in Term 3. Projects are offered in all areas of research in the School: Astrophysics; Biophysics; Condensed Matter Physics; Music Acoustics and Theoretical Physics. Projects are also offered by academics in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology. A list of projects and supervisors will be available in the term before students begin honours.\u00a0Students are assessed by submission of a research proposal, literature review, and final thesis. The research proposal is worth 10%, the literature review contributes 20% and the thesis contributes 70% to the final research mark. These will be marked by two assessors within the School, one of whom will be the student&#39;s supervisor. Students are required to give a short talk about their research at the end of the year, but this is not assessable.</p>\n",

More specifically, it considers how molecules in cells interact to provide specific functions (molecular and cellular physiology) and how organs, which are collections of cell types, have local and distant actions via neural and humoral (e.g. hormones) communication to sustain the life of an organism. The latter represents systems or integrative physiology. Physiology contributes to all major aspects of biology, including comparative biology, neuroscience, and the allied disciplines of pharmacology, anatomy and pathology.</p>",

In this minor, you will discover how policy is made and how policy problems are defined. You will explore the politics, values and ideology behind the decisions. You will develop skills to analyse policy, use evidence to develop policy advice, work with stakeholders to shape policy, and evaluate policy outcomes. You will reflect critically on the impact of policy on specific sectors and communities. You will explore the different ways that citizens, businesses, communities and advocacy organisations can participate in policy making that affects them, and work with government in formulating policy and delivering services.</p>\n<p>This minor is designed to complement your disciplinary major and develop policy-relevant skills to help you to make an impact in your chosen field of practice. It will prepare you for careers in government, politics, media, think tanks, international and local non-government organisations and businesses with an interest in solving problems and influencing social change.</p>",

Policy is part of every field of practice, which has led to a rapid growth in the need for policy professionals in government, business, and social and political organisations.</p>\n<p>The Master of Public Policy and Governance (MPPG) applies a social science perspective to questions of policy and management in modern organisations. You will acquire a solid grounding in policy analysis, policy evaluation and social research, the necessary skills and knowledge domains required for effective engagement within the policy process. You will be able to specialise in an area of direct relevance to your own interests, which may include Social Policy, International Development Policy or Policy Management.</p>\n<p>The program will prepare you for professional practice, by fostering analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policymaking, the significance of research and evidence in driving policy change and the role of stakeholders in effective policy implementation. The Master of Public Policy and Governance places emphasis on developing the skills and perspectives needed for proficient assessment, evaluation and sensitivity to the effectiveness of policy programs in terms of the impact they have on clients, customers and the public.</p>\n<p>Unique to the UNSW Master of Public Policy and Governance is the significant policy and research experience of the program&#39;s teaching staff. At UNSW, the staff involved in the MPPG have had direct experience either as policy makers or policy researchers in government, non-government organisations and, the business sectors. Combined, they have over 20 years direct experience working at high levels inside government, from providing policy support to the Council of Australian Governments through to conceptualising, designing and implementing large scale policy across the states. Staff are also actively involved with non-government organisations in providing effectively policy research and evidence to support their advocacy and lobbying activities. These teaching staff bring their real life experience to the classroom, revealing the relationship between theory, research and everyday practice.</p>\n<p>The Master of Public Policy and Governance aims to prepare you for work which requires analytical skills and a practical appreciation of the processes of policy-making and implementation. The program is oriented to the practice of policy, and prospective students are required to have relevant work experience. This may be in the public sector, unions, business or community organisations.</p>",

The Honours year introduces students to the investigative and research aspects of knowledge and consists of advanced lecture courses, an Honours thesis and seminar participation. Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians.</p>\n\n<p>Students who enrol in the Quantitative Data Science\u00a0Honours Stream are expected to have completed\u00a0the\u00a0 Quantitative Data Science major in the Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions (program 3959), or one of the other majors in that program including at least three level 3 MATH courses. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0data science\u00a0may also apply for entry to this stream.</p>\n\n<p>Honours in Quantitative Data Science can be completed full-time or part-time. Most students commence their enrolment in term 1\u00a0 but entry in term 3 is available subject to resources.\u00a0 Students should check the MathStats Honours webpages for application procedures and enrolment deadlines.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stream structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>The thesis component of Quantitative Data Science\u00a0honours requires a student to undertake an 18uoc thesis by enrolling in the course MATH4001 (Mathematics and Statistics Honours Thesis) in each of three successive terms. These courses form one thesis/project. Students (full or part-time)\u00a0can complete the honours thesis\u00a0 in any three consecutive terms of their honours enrolment.</p>\n\n<p>Students will also be required to participate in the weekly honours seminar, which will be timetabled as a joint class in the thesis courses. This seminar is intended to allow students to\u00a0practise their final honours seminar presentation, listen to presentations of other honours students and engage in other honours training activities. Students should also attend any appropriate seminars in their thesis area.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The thesis will be assessed by at least two academic staff. The supervisor or supervisors of the thesis is expected to submit a report, but will not be a marker for the thesis.

Thus solutions to health problems often lie outside the health system - in social policy, urban design, community cohesion, personal relationships, and the penal system, to name but a few. The Master of Public Health stream in Social Research provides students with training in sociological conceptualisations of health and in approaches to health issues using both quantitative/epidemiological and qualitative/interpretive methods. It consists of core MPH courses, with a stream-defining course on sociological approaches to public health, two research methodology courses, and a selection of either an SPHCM elective, project, internship or independent studies. The stream is taught by staff with a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds including sociology, psychology, political science, anthropology, ethnography and epidemiology.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who should do this stream?</strong></p>\n\n<p>This MPH degree focuses on the social aspects of health and social approaches to addressing public health problems. You may be a social science graduate seeking training in public health research skills, or a public health or healthcare practitioner wanting to develop your understanding of social influences on health and illness.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in carrying out research, the degree provides a clear pathway towards further academic research training (e.g. a PhD) or research in the workplace (government policy, program evaluation etc.). Graduates from this stream develop the knowledge and skills to enter postgraduate research degrees that require expertise in either social epidemiology or qualitative research, or both.</p>\n\n<p>This stream is for anyone who wants to change public health and health policy for the better - even when change means political action or social change outside the healthcare system. Much medical and health research does not make a difference, because it stays in the medical journals. This degree will equip you to see the social and structural problems that prevent useful policy change, and find ways to address them.</p>\n",

In addition to providing an appreciation of this rich and diverse discipline, a major in sociology will equip you with the intellectual and practical tools to tackle contemporary social problems and inequalities such as those related to race, gender, sexuality, and class.\u00a0 It will also help you to analyse the complexities of rapid social change, technological disruption, and political polarisation to better understand how to make change in the world. Sociology graduates are therefore ideally positioned to make an impact in roles associated with policy making and government, social and community services, and research and academia.

Our Honours students are supervised in their Honours project by some of Australia&#39;s finest mathematicians and statisticians.<br />\nStudents who enrol in the Statistics Honours Stream are expected to have completed a statistics or mathematics major in an undergraduate science or other mathematically focused program. Students who have completed degrees in other cognate disciplines and who are completing a project within the usual concerns of\u00a0statistics may also apply for entry to this stream.<br />\nHonours in Statistics\u00a0can be completed full-time or part-time.

This stream aims to prepare a graduate for a broad range of career opportunities in the various branches of Surveying and the numerous Spatial Information disciplines. To this end the stream covers general scientific and IT principles, as well as specialised Surveying and Spatial Information topics. Specialisation is provided for through the provision of elective courses offered in the third and fourth years of the program and the choice of a targeted final year thesis project often aligned with an external industry partner. <br /><br />The degree of BE in Surveying is recognised by the Board of Surveying and Spatial Information of New South Wales as meeting the requirements for entry as a candidate to become a Registered Surveyor. The degree is also recognised by the Institution of Surveyors, New South Wales, the Spatial Sciences Institute and Engineers Australia, for admission as corporate members.<br /><br />Suggestions for course sequences consistent with timetabling and availability can be found on the School website The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student&#39;s choice of courses. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions. Thus students should plan their enrolments appropriately.<br /><br /></p>",

All students will acquire Carbon Literacy, and a clear understanding of the Climate Science and Science-based Targets that every leader needs to know in order to help mitigate climate change and contribute meaningfully to strategies for adaptation and resilience in their organisations. We explore the broader impacts of business on nature, including biodiversity and species loss, and examine insights into the emerging field of Nature Positive Solutions. Students will be equipped with the skills to measure an organisation\u2019s environmental and social footprint, carry out a materiality analysis and prioritisation, and develop appropriate initiatives and strategies.</p>\n<p>Students will also learn about the social responsibilities of business, including concepts of stakeholder capitalism, shared value and social value, and best practice in working with communities. The most pressing issues for business are explored, such as EDI, Modern Slavery and social impacts of climate change.</p>\n<p>The concepts of Sustainable Value Creation and Net Positive Growth are embedded throughout this specialisation, providing an understanding of how we can identify and capture the opportunities that sustainability brings for innovation and value creation. This includes opportunities to develop a more sustainable business model, including a clear vision for sustainable growth.</p>\n<p>It will help students to become more valuable leaders for their organisation and society. They will complete this course with a more sustainable mindset and a sustainability toolkit that they can apply immediately in their organisation and in their life.</p>",

Individual student needs can be further met by substitution provisions within the programs.<br /><br />The Telecommunications stream consists of 168 UOC as described below. The stream structure outlined below gives one sequence of courses that fulfils the requirements of the degree. The timing of the general education courses and elective courses may be modified to optimize the student&#39;s choice of courses. While some courses are given twice a year, many courses are given only once a year. In addition, courses may have prerequisites and exclusions.

As a Theatre and Performance Studies student you will be equipped with the skills to analyse, interpret or work with a variety of performance forms as well as have the opportunity to follow a chosen area of specialisation within the major. The specialisation&#39;s contemporary focus explores experimental live arts, multimedia and dance practices as well as their political and social attributes within a global context. Its historical orientation will ground you with essential skills in playtext and genre analysis as well as with perspectives on national theatre traditions and canon formation. The major&#39;s offerings in creative practice will develop the skills you need to become a theatre practitioner and include courses in interdisciplinary collaboration, professional production, script-writing and solo performance. The specialisation&#39;s professionalising pathway offers internships and arts reviewing courses which emphasise links to Sydney-based production companies, venues and publishing networks. Our major specialisation is designed to critically and creatively engage you in the social, ethical and practical state of the contemporary performing arts from a range of historical and cultural perspectives.</p>",
