As the course title implies, one of the themes that we will encounter along the way is the idea of \u201creading\u201d itself: what special practices of reading do we cultivate as students of literature, where did these practices come from and how is the way we read changing and evolving today - as a result, for instance, of changes in the media landscape? Like other English subjects, one of the aims of this course is to help you sharpen your critical reading skills. But it is also one of our assumptions that reading and studying the history of literature in English is the single best way to become a better writer.</p>",

The course considers Hollywood as an early example of a genuinely global industry that initially sustained itself through the implementation of a range of industrial, economic, cultural, legal, quasi-legal, and indeed illegal conventions and practices, i.e., the star system, the production code, the studio system, the genre system, monopolistic practices like vertical integration, and the Classical Hollywood style of film-making.</p>",

Starting with the familiar and the everyday, this course introduces you to the breadth of contemporary media studies from television and the tradition of mass media studies, to telephony and the study of networked media and communication technologies. With an eye on the way that television and telephony have adapted to changing realities over the decades, this course explains how media and communication technologies have transformed the rhythms of everyday life, the organisation of domestic space, the boundaries between private and public, and our sense of involvement with national and public collectivities. In addition, the course examines the concept of mediation by exploring how both television and telephony shape the experience of time, distance, immediacy and liveness.</p>\n",

How did a few small countries in Europe (and later the United States) come to dominate so much of the world\u2019s wealth and power by 1900? How did they displace the great empires of the Middle East, South Asia and China? Between 1400 and the beginning of the twentieth century, an astonishing, global revolution took place. We call it \u2018modernity\u2019. Human beings moved from villages to cities, from face-to-face communities to vast and bewilderingly complex societies. Nations and nation-states replaced the great empires and grand monarchies. Political ideologies and racism had become as deeply ingrained in people\u2019s minds as the traditional religions. Towards the end, electricity and fossil fuels replaced human and animal muscle power, and machines drove peoples and things across the seas, over land and into the air.\u00a0ARTS1270 Global History\u00a0explains the making of the modern world to 1900. In addition, as a gateway to the history major, it provides the basis (in terms of both concepts and skills) for further studies in the history curriculum. You will learn how to interpret primary and secondary sources, compose historical arguments, and engage with key historical concepts and theories in the process.</p>\n",

Every day, all over the world from small villages to entire regions, social, political, and economic changes take place in the name of local and global development. Yet, what is development and why does it matter? In this course we think of development as change; change driven by particular ideas about what a good life should be. Communities all around the world are subject to policies and projects that seek to change their lives for the better. Some succeed, some do not. Some are designed locally, some are designed much further away. Some are the result of shared ideas about what makes human life better while others are challenges to the way things are and call for dramatic changes to society. Other major changes come about through external factors: the coronavirus pandemic, conflict and forced migration, climate change and extreme weather events, amongst others. In this course we explore what drives development interventions, their impacts on communities, and the ways they respond. We explore also the processes and influences that operate at a global level and that impact such fundamental concerns as human rights, population health, environmental and climate change, and migration.</p>\n\n<p>Through a series of nine key topic areas that form the content of the course, you will learn why development thinking \u2013 and by extension development practice \u2013 has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learned from past failure and successes. You will be exposed to a variety of geographic case studies to see how development works (or doesn&#39;t) on the ground. You will leave this course with an appreciation about the complexities of development and with a solid foundation of what issues and concerns around development manifest and ought to be addressed at local, national, international and global levels.</p>\n",

The processes of economic and political integration, heralded by the European Union, are under existential threat, and nationalism is on the rise. To the west, British disaffection with perceived loss of sovereignty has led to\u00a0a referendum passing\u00a0&#39;Brexit&#39;, indicating the intention of a member state to leave the EU for the first time. To its south, Europe is dealing with a refugee crisis brought on by wars in north Africa and the Middle East. On its Eastern flank, tensions with Russia are heightened, especially over Ukraine. The relationship of Europe with the USA in the era of Donald Trump&#39;s presidency is also in flux. All this is taking place while Europe has been reeling from the global financial crisis, with stringent austerity measures in some countries leading to great social deprivation and political unrest. This has created a resurgent right wing, which blames Europe&#39;s ills on immigrant populations, especially the Islamic community. Europe pressingly seeks to reconcile its liberal and secular ideals with the competing demands of nationalism and religious fundamentalism. This course will introduce the social, cultural and political crisis in contemporary Europe through a cultural lens.</p>\n",

This course will equip you with some of the skills necessary to begin formulating your own answers to these questions. You will be introduced to the idea of studying politics, both domestic and international, as an academic discipline, and to some of the key academic conventions and standards that are important to the discipline: the idea of evidence-based argument, for example, and the idea of ethical scholarship. We will also discuss the formation of the modern state system and interrogate the conceptualisation of the state that informs much contemporary theory and practice in politics at the national and international level.</p>\n\n<p>A substantial part of this course is devoted to the introduction of the main theoretical traditions that animate the study of politics and international relations. One of the central messages of the course is that different theoretical approaches generate different images of the world that build on particular assumptions. Therefore, while people may think they know what the current problems of politics and global politics are and how to solve them, one of the aims of this course is to alert you to other ways of seeing things. This should allow you to make a more confident decision about your own stance towards particular issues and to analyse these issues more thoroughly, but it should also make you question both your own and others\u2019 representations of the world.</p>\n",

During the first forty or so years of the twentieth century, traditional art forms underwent an unprecedented process of revolution and innovation, as artists and writers sought radically new ways to express the experience of modernity. We will consider the works of a range of individual European and North American modernist writers and film-makers, as well as examining some of the many collective movements, groupuscules and \u201cisms\u201d that sprang up during this period. A touchstone of our inquiry will be the vexed relationship between \u201cmodernity\u201d as a historical condition and \u201cmodernism\u201d as a cultural movement. What does it mean to be modern? What happens to art when traditional beliefs and ways of life enter a period of permanent crisis \u2013 a period, that is, when \u201call that is solid melts into air\u201d? And does modernist culture teach us ways to feel at home in modernity, or does it remind us of our alienation?</p>",

You\u00a0will examine the (dis)continuities between \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 self-making practices such as journaling/vlogging; and self-portraiture/selfies, to consider the ways in which media and technology both shape\u00a0and are shaped by socio-cultural understandings of identity formation. You\u00a0will explore the ways that technologies and media platforms constrain some \u2018selves\u2019 and enable others. You will be\u00a0invited to critically and creatively experiment with various mediums and platforms, to both cultivate digital literacy and query the modalities and affects of your digital presence. In doing so, you will consider the ways that self-making practices intersect with data-gathering practices, design processes, business models, and public policy. Topics include: life-hacking and the quantified self movement, microcelebrity and branding, digital intimacies, and biometrics and surveillance.</p>",

The course engages with narratives of imperialism embedded in contemporary and historical popular cultures, from Raj Nostalgia to Bollywood film, seeking to align these\u00a0with academic and public debates about history.

The course is organized thematically. It starts by framing East Asia in terms of its history of globalization through cultural and religious interaction. The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West. The formation of nation-state ideologies along Western lines led to evolving conceptions of their place in the world, the meaning of culture, the role of commerce, and the relationship of the individual to the state. But in the era of globalization, these issues are situated in a post-nation-state framework.</p>\n\n<p>The course thus concludes with East Asia&#39;s contributions to globalization.This course is taught in English and with readings in English.</p>\n",

Such development is often seen a synonym of progress; however, over the past few decades it has been increasingly recognised that such rapid change has produced an uneven social geography \u2013 marginalising significant populations \u2013 while also intensively degrading and polluting different environments. We will discuss how the idea of sustainable development has emerged as a response to this conundrum \u2013 an effort to redirect economic growth to produced more socially just and environmentally benign outcomes. The path to a sustainable future, however, is not straightforward, as environmental, social and economic issues are ultimately situated in contested political realms. In this course, you will study how human-environment interconnections, across different scales and in different contexts, come together to demonstrate how environmental issues are situated in, and shaped by political and economic contexts. This will include engaging with a number of key sustainability debates as well as the in-depth study of different examples from around the world.</p>\n",

In this course we will explore how climate change is perhaps better understood as a social, cultural and political phenomenon which is remaking the ways in which we understand our relationship with the Earth. How we understand climate, weather, nature and the environment are crucial for understanding contemporary global warming and our responses to it. We will\u00a0examine the underlying politics of climate change.\u00a0You\u00a0will garner\u00a0a conceptual and methodological toolkit for interpreting and making sense of the social aspects of climate change and the often intense political arguments that surround it. The course explores the history of climate science and the more recent emergence of a global consensus on anthropogenic global warming. The course goes on to consider recent work on abrupt climate change, climate modelling and the politics of climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies. The course draws on a multi-disciplinary framework for understanding the social, historical and political aspects of climate change, with insights from politics, sociology, and science and technical studies (STS). You\u00a0will be introduced to key areas of contemporary scholarly thinking in the environmental humanities \u2013 including political ecology, the sociology of scientific knowledge and contemporary political theory.</p>\n",

The (largely illegal) explosion of Australian pastoralism, accompanied by the massive and sudden dispossession of Aboriginal Australians, was part of a global settler boom that fed Britain\u2019s and America\u2019s industrialisation and global sway. That same boom helped, by mid-century, to transform the convict gulag into one of the world\u2019s most inclusive democracies \u2013 a social laboratory that inspired reform around the world for good and evil.

After analysing the startling Greek triumph over the Persian Empire in the early 5th century BC and its repercussions, the course goes on to examine the two-century arc of triumph and failure of Classical Greek polis civilization (ca. 500-338 BC). Finally, you\u00a0will turn to Alexander the Great and his conquests. Several themes will animate the course: the origin, nature, and evolution of economic and social structures; the origin, nature, and evolution of military and political institutions and practices; Greek democracy; Greek interaction with non-Greeks.</p>\n",

The tradition of French gastronomy is indeed an integral part of French identity that has been recognized in 2010 by the inclusion of the French gastronomic meal and its rituals in the list of intangible UNESCO cultural heritage. The behaviours and values associated with food and wine are an essential component of successful social and business interactions in France and other Francophone countries.

On the other, multicultural Europe seeks to include and recognise\u00a0people from a variety of faith traditions.

Lectures will address contemporary issues, such as the rise of Islamism, and study its roots in the political and intellectual formation of modern Europe. Looking at relevant film and literary texts, as well as utilising cultural and social analysis, you will address topics such as Islam and Europe, the relationship of Church and State, battles between science and religion, nihilism and the so-called &#39;death of god, atheism and the &#39;post-secular&#39; age.

At the same time, International Relations scholars have argued that these narrow, state-centric and military-centric approaches to security \u2013 and the concepts and discourses they rely on \u2013 are deeply implicated in the \u2018imperial-racial origins of IR\u2019 and unable to engage with contemporary security concerns related to issues such as climate justice, environmental security, food security, the Black Lives Matter movement, disinformation, ethnic strife, the evolution of terrorism, the corollaries of intervention, and the securitisation of migrants and refugees, amongst others. This course provides a critical evaluation of the traditional security studies scholarship, and introduces students to critical approaches to security, including feminist, postcolonial, poststructuralist, and emancipatory theoretical frameworks that extend beyond warfare and examine diverse modern security issues. We will analyse different sets of critical theoretical approaches and explore their analytical utility (as well as any biases/ blind spots) by investigating relevant case studies and contemporary security dilemmas. Overall, the course will enable you to recognise core differences between critical security scholarship and traditional security studies; identify and evaluate critical theories of security, and apply them to contemporary events and issues in global politics.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

In doing so, you\u00a0will also consider different approaches to regions and regionalism, and the problems and prospects therein.\u00a0The course will also introduce you\u00a0to the significant political, strategic and economic issues that the region poses and the foreign policies of major regional actors, including India, China, the US, Japan and Australia. These issues and challenges are both interstate and transnational in nature, and include strategic rivalry and competition between major regional actors, counter-piracy, maritime surveillance, and trade. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n",

In this\u00a0course, you will question the nature, constitution and effects of the contemporary global political economy from a critical perspective, discussing the variety of approaches to and understandings of global political-economic practices, actors, patterns and ideas. Introducing you to global political economy as a field of study and a space of human interaction, the course examines the relationship between politics and economics and the reasons why power, resources and privilege are often concentrated in particular hands. Scrutinising the past, present and future of the global political economy, the course outlines and overviews key histories in, approaches to and developments of the global economic order. By focusing on particular dynamics in areas such as international development, trade, finance, production, the environment and gender, the course shines a light on how inequality is generated and maintained, asking you to think carefully about the constitution and effects of who gets what in global politics today.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Subject Area: Politics and International Relations.

While an emphasis will be placed on the cultural dimensions of film, you will also develop your skills in film analysis as we consider the crucial role played by film aesthetics, genre and narrative conventions in shaping our understanding of cultural issues.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

This is manifested in the perceived excellence of French Haute Cuisine, born in the banquets of the Aristocracy and the Royal court in 17th century and in a culinary terminology that has conquered the world (ratatouille, patisserie, terroir). The tradition of French gastronomy is indeed an integral part of French identity that has been recognized in 2010 by the inclusion of the French gastronomic meal and its rituals in the list of intangible UNESCO cultural heritage. The behaviours and values associated with food and wine are an essential component of successful social and business interactions in France and other Francophone countries. They therefore constitute a rich entry into French culture that may facilitate future professional interactions and cultural sensitivity.</p>\n<p>Through the viewing of films and documentaries, and the reading of literary texts and excerpts from the culinary genre (recipe books, dictionaries, essays, and guides), this course will allow you to discover the evolution of French society through its rich culinary tradition and compare it to your own society. You will explore varied culinary practices in the Francophone world and meet industry professionals who will explain how they navigate the challenges of globalisation, sustainability or foreign influence.</p>\n<p>Even though the language of instruction is English, you will be required to complete the assessments in French if you have selected to take this course as a professional elective.</p>",

From the #metoo movement, to Black Lives Matter, to the Alt Right, to the Arab spring protests and\u00a0Occupy and Indignado movements: all around the world citizens are mobilising,\u00a0some because they want political change, others because they want to maintain the status quo.\u00a0What is change?

What <em>kind</em>\u00a0of change do political actors seek to achieve? In this course you will further explore these questions comparing processes of political change and actors involved in generating political change in Australia and other countries around the world. You will learn about the role of power, legitimacy, and insider and outsider positions in making political change work (or not). You will leave this course with a better understanding of what political change is, how it can be achieved, and what your own role can be in changing the world.\u00a0</p>",

These prompt an inquiry into past principles that demand our attention now. Historical achievements are reinterpreted, with the aim of stimulating alternative design strategies.</p>\n\n<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans are discussed, because their writings influenced designers in later epochs. A tradition of thinking about design stressed the significance of topics, such as order, proportion, analogy, symmetry, decorum, economy, ornament, the profile of mouldings, the angle of view, rhythmic measure, empathy, memory, monumentality and the play of light.</p>\n\n<p>Emphasis is placed on the analogy between a person and a design. This involves the theory of a human being as a \u2018type\u2019, whose constitution accords with built forms. Analysis of this accentuates human characteristics and actions, which are associated with privileged forms.

        "description": "<p> This course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary nature of city making that focuses on a cutting-edge, high-density urban infill project, Central Park, Sydney as its case study. The case study is used to explore the interdependencies of the professions at play; urban design, architecture, construction management, city planning, landscape architecture, interior architecture and industrial design. The entire development process for the urban infill project is investigated, from the earliest planning and site purchases through to completion, and from the broad contextual scale through to the design intricacies. This includes design innovations in green technologies, structure, construction, environmental and building service, framing within the wider context of infrastructure, governance and the political economy. A key question investigated in this course is: how do we engage local democracy to make urban density both sustainable and poetic in current global cities?</p>\n<p> </p>",

Even many plants in Australia are venomous and have a deadly sting. \u00a0The Australian environment provides many deadly challenges to its visitors. However, aside from simply having a reputation as being a dangerous place the characteristics which make the Australian flora and fauna so distinctive and the reasons why it is so distinctive are poorly understood by most people.</p>\n<p>In this course students will learn about how evolutionary isolation has made the Australian fauna and flora so distinct. Along the way students will learn about the deadly animals and plants of Australia and how to identify them. Students will also learn about why this long period of isolation has made the Australian fauna so vulnerable to the threats posed by introduced species. This course will involve some day trip excursions and will incur a small cost to students (approximately $100). </p>",

Unfortunately, only a small proportion of people ever gain more than a superficial understanding of natural selection and how evolution works. And that can be problematic given the important insights that evolution provides into the most difficult and persistent problems that plague 21st Century living, including antibiotic resistance, obesity, overpopulation, income inequality, gender inequity and the ideological warfare that surround sex and family life.</p>\n<p>\u00a0This course introduces students from all areas of the university to the power of evolutionary thinking, and how to use it responsibly to understand modern life and the controversial issues that inhere to it. In addition to introducing the original - often counterintuitive - insights evolution provides, we explore the relationships between evolutionary, social, cultural and economic processes.</p>\n<p>Learning involves on 2-hour lecture per week, plus a 1.5-2 hour workshop in which we will explore evolution using custom-designed video games and other interactive resources and data.</p>\n<p>Assessment comprises three quizzes and an essay.

Design is ubiquitous and infiltrates everyday life via its many forms, including design objects, environments, processes and systems. But, how did we get here?

Portfolio theory is used to provide a foundation for determining the relationship between expected risk and returns in financial and real asset investments. Dividend payouts and the choices between debt and equity financing, including methods of determining the cost of capital, are also covered. Further, this course includes analysis of the influence of the capital market environment, the implications of financial risk, taxation and the conflict of interest between managers and investors on the value and operation of businesses. The course develops distinct conceptual frameworks and specialised tools for solving real-world financial problems at both the personal and corporate level. Illustrations from real-life corporate practices are used to highlight the importance and relevance of financial management to the realisation of personal and corporate financial objectives. Examples include personal financial planning, funds management, capital raisings, portfolio selection of financial securities, private equity, public floats and the pricing of assets in the stock market.</p>\n",

Thereafter, the principles and applications of financial mathematics are introduced and used to value securities and investment decisions. Portfolio theory is used to provide a foundation for determining the relationship between expected risk and returns in financial and real asset investments. Dividend payouts and the choices between debt and equity financing, including methods of determining the cost of capital, are also covered. Further, this course includes analysis of the influence of the capital market environment, the implications of financial risk, taxation and the conflict of interest between managers and investors on the value and operation of businesses. The course develops distinct conceptual frameworks and specialised tools for solving real-world financial problems at both the personal and corporate level. Illustrations from real-life corporate practices are used to highlight the importance and relevance of financial management to the realisation of personal and corporate financial objectives. Examples include personal financial planning, funds management, capital raisings, portfolio selection of financial securities, private equity, public floats and the pricing of assets in the stock market.</p>",

Existing food hierarchies have been overturned and diet orthodoxies disrupted. We are learning more and more how changes to diet can promote or discourage chronic disease like diabetes, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s. At the same time, we are increasingly aware of the way that food production, packaging, and distribution is impacting the environment and contributing to climate change. This leads many to consider the ethics of food creation and consumption.</p>\n<p>This course will give you insights into the breadth and depth of food science - a rapidly evolving discipline. The course will introduce you to some of the common scientific principles, practices, and challenges related to our food systems. You will examine the interactions between the food industry and consumer ethics, health, and behaviour.

Issues like these are why subjects like space mining are in need of people from other disciplines, to help understand all of the other problems in this and similar fields and how those problems might be solved.</p>\n<p>In this course, we will explore what opportunities this and other world-changing engineering challenges have for those who are not engineers. Students will be taken through the engineering lifecycle of new technologies and encouraged to think about how their unique skills can be applied to these projects.</p>",

This course offers students a comprehensive introduction to the Australian legal system, a common law system, and contrasts it with the civil law system.</p>\n<p><br />The course will examine the historical origins of the Australian legal system, some of the principles underpinning our legal system, including the importance of the concept of the rule of law. It also covers the operation of the principal institutions of the legal system, the legislative and executive arms of government and the judiciary and courts. This will include the jurisdiction of Australian courts, the process by which cases are decided and the doctrine of precedent, consideration of alternative methods of dispute resolution and an examination of the role of the legal profession. There will also be an overview of the main branches of law.</p>\n<p><br />Aboriginal customary law will be looked at and there will be a critical analysis of the circumstances of the adoption of the common law in Australia and the effect on the indigenous people. There will also be examination of the recognition of customary law and native title.</p>\n<p><br />No prior knowledge of the Australian legal system is required. A major focus of the course is the social relevance of law in our daily lives and in today\u2019s society.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Topics</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The Rule of Law</li><li>The Common Law Legal System</li><li>Other Types of Legal Systems</li><li>The Separation of Powers</li><li>The Federal Constitution</li><li>Parliamentary Sovereignty</li><li>Legislation by Parliament</li><li>Hierarchy of Courts</li><li>The Doctrine of Precedent</li><li>The Legal Profession</li><li>Alternative Forms of Dispute Resolution</li><li>Tribunals</li><li>Common Law and Equity</li><li>Contract Law</li><li>Tort Law</li><li>Criminal Law</li><li>Australian Consumer Law</li><li>Employment Law</li></ul>",

Popular (incorrect) answers include energy, heat, faeces and sweat. Surprisingly, this question has also baffled health professionals including general practitioners, dietitians and professional trainers. </p>\n<p>This course will lift the veil on weight loss by tracing every atom you eat into and out of your body, and you will learn the fate of fat during weight loss, that is, it is converted to carbon dioxide and water and exits your body mainly through your lungs. Along the way, you will also learn how humans convert foods into useful energy, what exactly is happening in your bodies during weight loss and weight gain, and by the end you will be able to critically examine popular weight loss claims as well as your own diet and lifestyle. Diet myths and wellness nonsense topple like dominoes along the way. </p>\n<p>No prior scientific knowledge is assumed as we aim to provide you with the knowledge to answer this big, fat myth.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Students enrolled in a Faculty of Science program should not take this course but can enrol in the equivalent course, BABS1111.\u00a0</p>",

The most common interface between the general public and science is often through science fiction; hence, science fiction is used as a teaching aid to stimulate student interest and as a starting point from which to communicate the science, and its likely future development. This course also examines the interaction between science and society, encouraging students to consider how culture influences science and vice versa. This course aims to provide students with the level of scientific and technological literacy required to take an informed part in debate on important scientific issues.</p>\n<p>The areas covered are: the physics of space and time; astronomy; space travel and exploration; astrobiology: life in the Universe; computers &amp; robotics, artificial intelligence &amp; human intelligence; the future of the human race; the future of planet Earth, including an examination of the physics of climate change; a brief look at the place of physics in popular culture is included.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Students enrolled in a Faculty of Science program should not take this course.</p>",

What is the relation between music, sex and cheesecake? Can music make you smarter, and what is the Mozart Effect? Why does that tune get stuck in my head? How old must a person be before they can hear and appreciate music?\u00a0You will address these and related questions through examination of the music psychology literature, and the critical evaluation of your own musical attitudes, beliefs and behaviours.</p>\n<p><br />\u00a0</p>",

Each of these topics will be discussed with reference to engaging case studies of current research and current community-based projects. Through the exploration of these topics, you will learn about the characteristic linguistic properties of Australian languages and apply analytical skills to the description of Australian language data. There will be a focus on how new ways of speaking are created, how languages are lost, and the ways in which Aboriginal speakers are teaching and reviving their traditional languages today. You will work with a selection of authentic NSW Aboriginal language material from State Library of NSW collections. In doing so, you will have hands-on experience in how to find and utilise rich archival linguistic material and the ethical practices in the management and use of Aboriginal language materials. You will take away from this course a deepened understanding of social and cultural diversity as seen through the lens of language, analytical methods and critical thinking skills, and knowledge of research ethics and intellectual integrity.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This is an intermediate (Level 2) Information Systems (IS) course. In this course, you will examine the basic concepts and tools of supply chain management within the broader framework of an organisation&#39;s overall competitive strategy. The supply chain, which comprises all aspects of the sourcing of inputs from upstream suppliers, the internal value-adding processes and the distribution of outputs to downstream customers, is central to the overall success of any organisation. Any organisation that does not align its overall corporate strategy and its supply chain strategy will struggle to successfully deliver products and services to the market in a form that customers value. While it is not necessary for participants to be highly skilled in mathematics to undertake this course, you are expected to be familiar with, or be prepared to acquire, basic knowledge about the following concepts: basic probability and statistics, probability distributions and standard deviations (particularly the normal distribution), means and weighted averages, basic algebra. You will be expected to be able to perform some basic algebraic and statistical calculations in this course. This course offers a broad examination of the key issues involved in the management of supply chains. It places supply chain management in a strategic context and requires a blend of managerial and technological knowledge and skills. However, the course begins with a guided analysis of the strategic context of the organisation, so it can be taken early in your degree program, before any other strategy courses have been completed. This course is well suited to a broad range of students not only those involved in manufacturing industries as the concepts, processes and methods are readily adaptable to organisations that provide hard or soft product/service combination industries. One full Unit is devoted to service supply chains. There are numerous other references and opportunities to apply the theory to service supply chains in both the Unit notes and the associated textbook.</p>",

Increases in leisure time and discretionary spending have led to a proliferation of public events, celebrations, and entertainment, making the events sector one of the fastest growing segments of tourism in the world. Countries and cities compete vigorously for mega events such as the Olympics, World Cup, and World Fairs. Societies are increasingly holding smaller scale events such as fairs, festivals, community markets, parades, or sporting events. Governments support and promote events as part of their strategies for economic development and destination marketing as these events serve as a means of creating awareness of a destination and enhancing visitation. Most events require considerable investments on planning and organisation to ensure the maximum possible benefit for all stakeholders. Inappropriate management can lead to negative economic, environmental, and social impacts.

Whether it is from renewable energy sources or not, they all rely on metals and minerals to operate or to be built. Wherever you look you see metals and minerals and as remote as it may seem, all these goods started in a pit. In this course you will develop an awareness for the importance of the mining industry in our lives. Together, we will explore how commodities are extracted from the ground and who are involved at various stages of the mining operation. The topics covered in this course are geology, mining, mineral processing, safety, the impact of mining on the environment, and economics. We will also discuss employability in the mining industry, which employs people of various backgrounds (e.g. geologists, mining engineers, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, process &amp; chemical engineers, lawyers, finance, etc.) and offers competitive salaries.

Over the last few years we have seen mass bleaching events and unprecedented levels of coral mortality around the world. Like many other ecosystems, coral reefs are under threat from a warming and acidifying ocean. To mitigate against future damage, we need to understand these threatened ecosystems, how they are affected by the physical and chemical environment, and how threats can be reduced to converse the coral reef systems.</p>\n<p>This course aims to provide you with that broad understanding of the systems, threats and conversation efforts. You will learn about\u00a0\u00a0the components that make up a coral reef system: the coral animal/plant symbiosis, fish, algae, invertebrates and larger mammals, and the interactions between them. You will also learn about the physical environment: temperature, ocean currents, ocean chemistry that strongly affect the coral system, the climate change and how all these systems are being affected by climate change. Finally, you will investigate major threats faced by coral reefs and explore how we can manage and conserve these ecosystems.</p>\n<p>The course will be delivered in a combination of online and on-field modes. You will be able to access online modules to gain an understanding of the coral ecosystems and prepare for the\u00a0\u00a0field trip at Lady Elliot Island Reef Resort. On the island you will be introduced to the incredible flora and fauna and conduct a field experiment on the reef.</p>\n<p>The course will include a compulsory field trip to Lady Elliot Island that will incur personal costs to students.</p>",

Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world\u2019s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music? How much do we grasp the beauty, the yearning, and the spirituality in that music? What can we learn that will deepen our appreciation, understanding, and perhaps performance of the many musical expressions available to us today?</p>\n\n<p>This World Music course surveys and examines the relationships between music, the society in which it is performed, and individual selves. It explores both traditional and contemporary music of Aboriginal Australia, South-east Asia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East, West Africa and the Caribbean, and marginal Europe. It examines how musical practices express, shape, and allow for the individual and collective construction and negotiation of identity, ethnicity, gender, spirituality and class. It investigates how transformations in music both as social practice and as sound chart responses to modernity, state intervention, globalisation, conflict, dispossession and migration. The course also fosters direct experience of music in diverse cultural contexts through field work.</p>\n",

But what do musicians do with their bodies, voices and instruments to get other bodies toe-tapping, dancing, or moshing? How do musicians and listeners become one, a communion, or a rite? We begin to answer these questions with the understanding that musical sound is a powerful force for social interaction (grooves, in a broader sense). At the same time, we address these questions with the understanding that here is no simple relationship between what musicians produce and the social and cultural meanings ascribed to their productions. Popular music may also be considered as a cultural text that is read, received, and interpreted by both individuals and groups.</p>\n<p>This course covers a wide variety of popular musics, ranging from the locally produced to the latest global trends, through a survey of the historical and social development of key genres, such as, blues, country, reggae, rock and roll, Motown, soul, hard rock, disco, hardcore, metal, grunge, techno, rap and Latin forms.

        "description": "<p>Since its beginnings around a century ago, jazz has consistently enthused listeners with the inventiveness, expressiveness and virtuosity of its performers, and the variety of its styles. Beginning with African American chants, field hollers, early blues and urban dance forms, this course traces a history of the music, outlining the development and details of various styles of jazz, both in the United States and abroad. Tracing the changing locations in which the music has developed, it examines the roles of individual artists and musical collectivities in the innovation of styles. It investigates the dissemination of jazz through emerging media technologies, and notes the influence of other music on jazz musicians: popular music, rhythm and blues, soul, rock, classical music and world music, such as Latin American music, French gypsy music, South African kwela and mbqanga. As jazz has become the scintillating soundtrack to many lives, the course examines both the practical use of jazz as sound and image in film, literature and the visual arts, and some of the many meanings listeners have ascribed to it. The course introduces\u00a0you\u00a0to critical debates surrounding jazz: debates of race, authenticity, ownership, gender and commercialization. The course engages you in the process of informed listening.</p>\n",

Psychologists and biologists have a different view \u2013 that attraction and love are encoded by hormones and other chemicals activating brain systems of reward and connections with others. Yet, we all agree that sex, love, and attraction exert powerful effects on our lives by shaping our romantic partnerships, our desire to reproduce, and how we parent our offspring.</p>\n\n<p>In this course you will be introduced to the study of sex, love, and attraction in humans and other animals from a broad-based perspective including comparative, psychobiological, cross-cultural, and evolutionary approaches. Along the way, you will learn about physiological, behavioural, cognitive, and social factors involved in sex, love, and attraction. An emphasis of the course is placed on evolutionary concepts and how these could be used to interpret sex, love, and attraction. This course will enable you to gain a better understanding of evolutionary psychology and apply principles from this discipline to examine various issues related to sex, love, and attraction such as relationships, sexual behaviour, social monogamy, paternity, parenting, and menopause.</p>\n",

In the classroom you will read and discuss key texts, and in the field you will carry out site and artefact analysis. Crucially, you will encounter domestic experience through the voices of those who have lived them: in addition to reading historical accounts, you will be introduced to the practice of oral history, making recordings and analysing the accounts of the lived experience of the Australian home.</p>\n",

The dissemination of information can now be achieved much faster than traditional print media via the digital environment. Access to the processing and promulgation of information is also made possible through the availability of computer equipment and software packages which are now priced reasonably within the financial reach of many individuals. This democratisation of information access has produced a profound impact on how information is being generated, packaged and communicated to society. The increased proliferation of unintelligible and uncommunicable information in both the print and electronic media, and cyberspace is a pertinent case in point. These issues will be explored in a series of lectures and tutorials which examine theory, methodology and case studies.</p>\n",

In the course we will look at the principles of counting, known as enumerative combinatorics, to count discrete objects when the numbers involved are too great or the conditions are too complex to simply list the objects. We will consider permutations, combinations, sets and multisets, and special counting sequences. Tools such as generating functions, the principle of inclusion and exclusion, and symmetry will extend the range of scenarios we can count. Applications such a discrete probability and measurements of power will be considered.</p>",
