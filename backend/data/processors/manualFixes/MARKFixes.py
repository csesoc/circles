Copy this into a new file for the relevant faculty's fixes: 
e.g. COMPFixes.py, ACCTFixes.py, PSYCFixes.py

Apply manual [code] fixes to processed conditions in conditionsProcessed.json so 
that they can be fed into algorithms.

If you make a mistake and need to regenerate conditionsProcessed.json, then you
can run:
    python3 -m data.processors.conditionsPreprocessing

To then run this file:
    python3 -m data.processors.manualFixes.MARKFixes
