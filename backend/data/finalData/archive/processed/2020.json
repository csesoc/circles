The course answers this question by moving beyond the dominant tropes of the British Raj, replete with civilising missions, bejewelled maharajas and tiger hunts, to present a critical interrogation of colonial dynamics, demonstrating the relationships between imperial oppression, anti-colonial violence and Gandhian nonviolence, which culminated in the independence of India and the creation of East and West Pakistan, in 1947.",
