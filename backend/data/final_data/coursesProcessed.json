An analytics mindset is the ability to: (1) ask the right question; (2) extract, transform and load relevant data; (3) apply appropriate data analytic techniques; and (4) interpret and share the results with stakeholders.\nThe course gives students the opportunity to understand the importance of data and analytics to accounting and business management environments. Students complete case based problems throughout the course that require hands-on use of analytics tools. Students learn how data analytics can add value to business by providing powerful new insights to inform business decisions. Students learn to identify, interpret and use different forms of data to determine what is wrong and why it is so (technical accounting skills) as well how they would digitally communicate derived insights to stakeholders.\u00a0\nData and analytics are transforming business and have major implications for the role of graduate accountants in business. Increasingly, accountants are competing with data analysts and scientists. However, accountants are still the preferred trusted business advisors given their historic role in preparing financial information. This course is designed to give graduates a much sought after skill set which will equip them to add value to organizations in data driven business environments.\nAcknowledgement is given to the Ernst &amp; Young Foundation&#39;s Analytical Mindset Framework which informs the curriculum development of this course. \n.",

The course contextualises the science of acoustics, lighting and comfort within architectural design with an emphasis on environmental data collection, analysis and application to optimise IEQ and environmental performance. The role of architectural design in mitigating indoor and outdoor thermal comfort impacts is explored through real-world case-studies and parametric modelling. The significance of daylighting and artificial lighting design in IEQ and building environmental performance is investigated through the utilisation of numerical techniques and software applications. The appraisal and design of acoustic strategies to satisfy regulatory controls and optimise IEQ is supported through the application of acoustic principles to student\u2019s individual studio designs. At the completion of the course students will be able to identify, evaluate and apply strategies to optimise IEQ integrated with architectural design compliant with the regulatory standards applicable to environmental performance.\n",

It produces a historical and conceptual map of the institution that dominated the global film industry in the twentieth century, and which continues to do so today. In focusing on cinema as a socio-cultural and economic force, both in the United States and across the globe, it examines how Hollywood has historically produced and distributed a powerful cultural imaginary and devised methods to encourage audiences to consume it. The course considers Hollywood as an early example of a genuinely global industry that initially sustained itself through the implementation of a range of industrial, economic, cultural, legal, quasi-legal, and indeed illegal conventions and practices, i.e., the star system, the production code, the studio system, the genre system, monopolistic practices like vertical integration, and the Classical Hollywood style of film-making.",

You will also learn basic language learning strategies to make your learning process more effective. The course introduces you to some facets of Hispanic societies and culture and, in this way, gives you a better understanding of life in Hispanic-speaking countries and also a basic insight into the culture of the Spanish speaking world. We are the first and only university in Australia using the innovative Online Coaching program which offers you a unique opportunity to work outside of class with a personal, native-speaker language coach located in a Spanish Speaking country in a real-time, online learning environment. We hope that this unique personal experience will be truly enjoyable and will motivate you to continue learning Spanish.\n",

        "description": "Development is everywhere. Every day, all over the world from small villages to entire regions, social, political, and economic changes take place in the name of local and global development. Yet, what is development and why does it matter? In this course we think of development as change; change driven by particular ideas about what a good life should be. Communities all around the world are subject to policies and projects that seek to change their lives for the better. Some succeed, some do not. Some are designed locally, some are designed much further away. Some are the result of shared ideas about what makes human life better while others are challenges to the way things are and call for dramatic changes to society. Other major changes come about through external factors: the coronavirus pandemic, conflict and forced migration, climate change and extreme weather events, amongst others. In this course we explore what drives development interventions, their impacts on communities, and the ways they respond. We explore also the processes and influences that operate at a global level and that impact such fundamental concerns as human rights, population health, environmental and climate change, and migration.\n\nThrough a series of nine key topic areas that form the content of the course, you will learn why development thinking \u2013 and by extension development practice \u2013 has changed over time, and the extent to which its architects have learned from past failure and successes. You will be exposed to a variety of geographic case studies to see how development works (or doesn&#39;t) on the ground. You will leave this course with an appreciation about the complexities of development and with a solid foundation of what issues and concerns around development manifest and ought to be addressed at local, national, international and global levels.\n",

The processes of economic and political integration, heralded by the European Union, are under existential threat, and nationalism is on the rise. To the west, British disaffection with perceived loss of sovereignty has led to\u00a0a referendum passing\u00a0&#39;Brexit&#39;, indicating the intention of a member state to leave the EU for the first time. To its south, Europe is dealing with a refugee crisis brought on by wars in north Africa and the Middle East. On its Eastern flank, tensions with Russia are heightened, especially over Ukraine. The relationship of Europe with the USA in the era of Donald Trump&#39;s presidency is also in flux. All this is taking place while Europe has been reeling from the global financial crisis, with stringent austerity measures in some countries leading to great social deprivation and political unrest. This has created a resurgent right wing, which blames Europe&#39;s ills on immigrant populations, especially the Islamic community. Europe pressingly seeks to reconcile its liberal and secular ideals with the competing demands of nationalism and religious fundamentalism. This course will introduce the social, cultural and political crisis in contemporary Europe through a cultural lens.\n",

This course will equip you with some of the skills necessary to begin formulating your own answers to these questions. You will be introduced to the idea of studying politics, both domestic and international, as an academic discipline, and to some of the key academic conventions and standards that are important to the discipline: the idea of evidence-based argument, for example, and the idea of ethical scholarship. We will also discuss the formation of the modern state system and interrogate the conceptualisation of the state that informs much contemporary theory and practice in politics at the national and international level.\n\nA substantial part of this course is devoted to the introduction of the main theoretical traditions that animate the study of politics and international relations. One of the central messages of the course is that different theoretical approaches generate different images of the world that build on particular assumptions. Therefore, while people may think they know what the current problems of politics and global politics are and how to solve them, one of the aims of this course is to alert you to other ways of seeing things. This should allow you to make a more confident decision about your own stance towards particular issues and to analyse these issues more thoroughly, but it should also make you question both your own and others\u2019 representations of the world.\n",

Genre films work within and have the opportunity to reflect on society\u2019s primary myths of identity and individuality, freedom and responsibility, cultural stability and social change. This course will consider some of the most fascinating questions raised by genre films: What are the parameters for standardization and innovation within film genres? How do individual filmmakers rework the conventions of a genre to maintain its relevance their time? In what sense can film genres operate as instigators of change? How do genre films reflect the ravages of history?\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n",

This course creates opportunities to think creatively in intercultural contexts. Through digital workshops, field trips and creative encounters with producers, you will develop practical skills in designing creative projects and building a network of contacts for future collaboration across the region. The course begins with a pre-program orientation to cultural performance and creative production at UNSW Sydney. We then travel to Manila for a two-week study program of field trips and workshops hosted by the University of the Philippines. The city of Manila is pivotal in the trans-regional circulation of creative labour and increasingly connected through migration and trade with Australia. This course offers a transformative overseas experience for students wanting to work in the world today with creative arts, media production and digital technologies.\u00a0Students will be required to self-fund their travel to Manila. Students may be eligible for funding through the Australian Government&#39;s New Colombo Plan for this course.\u00a0\n",

At the same time, the United States remains the world&#39;s greatest power, exercising an enormous say in global governance, from economics\u00a0to the environment. Focusing particularly on the peculiar 20th-century US histories of class, race, religion and global engagement, you will learn how the world&#39;s oldest liberal democracy has become such a vital and fraught force in the contemporary world.",

The course engages with narratives of imperialism embedded in contemporary and historical popular cultures, from Raj Nostalgia to Bollywood film, seeking to align these\u00a0with academic and public debates about history. We will reflect on the legacies of violence and nonviolence in India, and on the enduring impact of imperialism in the region.\u00a0\n",

The course is organized thematically. It starts by framing East Asia in terms of its history of globalization through cultural and religious interaction. The course then turns to fundamental cultural commonalities centring on statecraft, institutions, education and notions of civilization that united and divided the region. Cross cultural comparisons among China, Japan, and Korea highlight the global and regional dimensions of cultural change in East Asia. These frame cultural similarities and differences that influenced the varying approaches to modernity taken by Chinese, Japanese and Korean activists when East Asia came under increasing pressure from the West. The formation of nation-state ideologies along Western lines led to evolving conceptions of their place in the world, the meaning of culture, the role of commerce, and the relationship of the individual to the state. But in the era of globalization, these issues are situated in a post-nation-state framework.\n\nThe course thus concludes with East Asia&#39;s contributions to globalization.This course is taught in English and with readings in English.\n",

The authoritarian regimes of Marcos, Suharto (including the 1965 killings in Indonesia), Mahathir, Lee Kuan Yew, the Khmer Rouge, Burma/Myanmar, the monarchy and military in Thailand, and Vietnam since 1989 will provide some case studies through which to analyse Southeast Asian political dynamics, including corruption, nepotism, social movements, the impact of the Internet and Facebook trolls on elections, the rise of populist leaders, and the links between religion and politics. In addition, you will learn about contemporary issues such as migration, the rise of the middle classes, the many faces of tourism, and ethnic minorities such as the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar.\n",

Such development is often seen a synonym of progress; however, over the past few decades it has been increasingly recognised that such rapid change has produced an uneven social geography \u2013 marginalising significant populations \u2013 while also intensively degrading and polluting different environments. We will discuss how the idea of sustainable development has emerged as a response to this conundrum \u2013 an effort to redirect economic growth to produced more socially just and environmentally benign outcomes. The path to a sustainable future, however, is not straightforward, as environmental, social and economic issues are ultimately situated in contested political realms. In this course, you will study how human-environment interconnections, across different scales and in different contexts, come together to demonstrate how environmental issues are situated in, and shaped by political and economic contexts. This will include engaging with a number of key sustainability debates as well as the in-depth study of different examples from around the world.\n",

Australia led the dramatic pan-imperial shift from self-government to autocracy in the aftermath of the American Revolution \u2013 a shift that fundamentally changed what it meant to be a British subject everywhere. The (largely illegal) explosion of Australian pastoralism, accompanied by the massive and sudden dispossession of Aboriginal Australians, was part of a global settler boom that fed Britain\u2019s and America\u2019s industrialisation and global sway. That same boom helped, by mid-century, to transform the convict gulag into one of the world\u2019s most inclusive democracies \u2013 a social laboratory that inspired reform around the world for good and evil.

After analysing the startling Greek triumph over the Persian Empire in the early 5th century BC and its repercussions, the course goes on to examine the two-century arc of triumph and failure of Classical Greek polis civilization (ca. 500-338 BC). Finally, you\u00a0will turn to Alexander the Great and his conquests. Several themes will animate the course: the origin, nature, and evolution of economic and social structures; the origin, nature, and evolution of military and political institutions and practices; Greek democracy; Greek interaction with non-Greeks.\n",

Some epistemological issues that the course might explore include these: what it is for a thought or claim to be true; what it is for a thought or claim to be rationally well supported; what it is for a thought or claim to be knowledge; what it is to have knowledge via the senses; what it is to have knowledge purely via reason; and whether it might be impossible for us ever to have any knowledge or rational support at all.\n",

The tradition of French gastronomy is indeed an integral part of French identity that has been recognized in 2010 by the inclusion of the French gastronomic meal and its rituals in the list of intangible UNESCO cultural heritage. The behaviours and values associated with food and wine are an essential component of successful social and business interactions in France and other Francophone countries. They therefore constitute a rich entry into French culture that may facilitate future professional interactions and cultural sensitivity.\nThrough the viewing of films and documentaries, and the reading of literary texts and excerpts from the culinary genre (recipe books, dictionaries, essays, and guides), this course will allow you to discover the evolution of French society through its rich culinary tradition and compare it to your own society.\u00a0You will explore varied culinary practices in the Francophone world and meet industry professionals who will explain how they navigate the challenges of globalisation, sustainability or foreign influence.",

You will explore development strategies including liberalism, industrialisation, socialism, neo-liberalism and the recent shift to more state-directed societies in the context of ethnic, class, gender and political divisions within Latin America and its relationships with other parts of the world including the United States, Europe and Asia.\n",

What role do international and state actors play in promoting better development, or in holding it back? In order to find the answer to these questions, you will learn about contemporary academic and policy debates about international development and the quest to find solutions to global inequality and persistent underdevelopment.You are encouraged to learn different ways to think about development, understand the role of international actors in promoting specific development outcomes, evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different explanatory accounts, find your own position and apply your critical insight to real-world challenges. You will learn about a variety of structural forces that can impede development outcomes, including conflict, communicable diseases, natural resources, geo-politics, and governance institutions. In addition to international actors, you will learn about the growing role of non-governmental organizations and civil society in a global world, and explore the role of China and Japan as emerging international development actors.",

Lectures will address contemporary issues, such as the rise of Islamism, and study its roots in the political and intellectual formation of modern Europe. Looking at relevant film and literary texts, as well as utilising cultural and social analysis, you will address topics such as Islam and Europe, the relationship of Church and State, battles between science and religion, nihilism and the so-called &#39;death of god, atheism and the &#39;post-secular&#39; age.

        "description": "International Security has traditionally been analysed through (neo)realist theoretical frameworks that focus exclusively on the state as the referent of security, and investigate issues as the causes of war and armed conflict, alliances, strategy, arms control and deterrence. At the same time, International Relations scholars have argued that these narrow, state-centric and military-centric approaches to security \u2013 and the concepts and discourses they rely on \u2013 are deeply implicated in the \u2018imperial-racial origins of IR\u2019 and unable to engage with contemporary security concerns related to issues such as climate justice, environmental security, food security, the Black Lives Matter movement, disinformation, ethnic strife, the evolution of terrorism, the corollaries of intervention, and the securitisation of migrants and refugees, amongst others. This course provides a critical evaluation of the traditional security studies scholarship, and introduces students to critical approaches to security, including feminist, postcolonial, poststructuralist, and emancipatory theoretical frameworks that extend beyond warfare and examine diverse modern security issues. We will analyse different sets of critical theoretical approaches and explore their analytical utility (as well as any biases/ blind spots) by investigating relevant case studies and contemporary security dilemmas. Overall, the course will enable you to recognise core differences between critical security scholarship and traditional security studies; identify and evaluate critical theories of security, and apply them to contemporary events and issues in global politics.\n\u00a0",

Through ethnography and interactions with people in place, you will develop practical skills in how one engages in face-to-face encounters of a qualitative and ethnographic nature, to develop understandings of how people locate themselves in the place world. People live their lives in cities, villages, townships, and across homelands, and make powerful attachments to place as home, or threat, a place of substance or transience. How do we tell stories of these encounters, and how do we find our own ethnographic voice?\u00a0Places, landscapes and seascapes - real or imagined - encode and express identity. They are also locations for conflict and contestation. In this course you will use theories and case studies from anthropology and sociology in conjunction with a student designed fieldwork project to examine and better understand the relations between people and place.

This course aims to take account of the abiding relevance of Austen&#39;s work in the early 21st century in two distinct but related ways. On the one hand, it focuses on Austen&#39;s juvenilia and novels as social and cultural products of their time. It examines how her works interact self-consciously with contemporary romantic, gothic and sentimental fiction as well as &#39;converse&#39; with each other to form a dynamic and intellectually challenging body of work. On a more theoretical level, it explores the various components of Austen&#39;s literary style that allow her to speak to present-day readers: her use of irony, her ability to illuminate the subtle transformation of character over time, and her unique intermingling of romance and realism. Through these two lenses, the module demonstrates the continuing relevance of Austen&#39;s literary and moral worldview.\n",

This course will trace\u00a0the historical emergence and circulation of this genre from Edgar Allan Poe and Conan Doyle through to its contemporary global proponents.

ARTS3054 traces the evolution of this genre from its origins in the bildungsroman, or \u201cnovel of education\u201d, to its most recent permutations in current fiction and film. Our selection of examples will range widely across media, time periods and geographical locations, pairing the classical with the contemporary and the canonical with the subversive. As well as asking why the transition from youth to maturity became such an important concern in modern literature, we will consider how this narrative template has been tested by changing historical conditions and how such narratives can help us to understand our own experiences of growing up in a rapidly changing world.\n\u00a0",

Media technologies\u00a0play key roles in the sciences of climate change and extinction. For example, the natural sciences use computer modelling extensively, and also rely on global media networks that both circulate environmental data and allow for collaboration and discussion among scientists. Media technologies\u00a0also play a role in bringing climate change and the natural science to the public. In the process, they help frame the way climate change and extinction are discussed. They thus play a fascinating if often conflicted series of roles in setting key social and political agendas with regard to the Anthropocene, climate change, and the extinction crisis. On the other hand, dealing with climate change and extinction have challenged the way that media and communications work. The mainstream media has had to change its approach to what counts as news, and to the way it sets agendas. Journalists have had to grapple with complex science in new ways. At the same time, social media has augmented and often by-passed more traditional media platforms. This has transformed communications around environmental issues such as climate change and extinction. All this has created an increasingly complex setting both for the communication of science and for political communication around the Anthropocene. You will gain insight into the history, present and future of the increasingly important relations between media, communication and life and death. You will explore the ways in which climate change and extinction are taken up in media and communications theory, in everyday and working life, and in practices such as journalism, science, documentary making, online discussion and political communication.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",

From election campaigns to radicalisation; from transnational personal relationships to gaming; from the constitution of the global economy to online dating; media technologies play a crucial role.

During the course, you will be encouraged \u00a0to capture and study media-related events and developments as they unfold. At the beginning of the term three to four significant, exemplary, on-going topics, news stories, or developments involving the media will be chosen. The rest of the term, including lectures and tutorial readings and discussions, will be organised around two to three broad themes that are based on the chosen topics.\n\nThe key focus will be on the application of relevant theories, frameworks and concepts on these topics, and an exploration of appropriate methodologies for their analysis. The topics covered could include, for instance, digital media affordances, political communication as public strategy, online radicalisation, social media use and counter-publics, the political economy of IT industries, or surveillance and security, covering the themes of media in the public domain and media in the private domain, as well as the intersections of the two. The methodologies discussed could, in turn, include textual analysis and deconstruction, auto-ethnography, and conjunctural analysis. The emphasis will be on situating media analysis and theory within broader socio-cultural and political contexts.\n",

Case studies engage the varied and multiple experiences of urbanism, by for instance, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality and so on, but also in times of increasing natural hazards and environmental awareness. Contemporary perspectives include (post)colonialism, critical race theory, environmentalism and consumerism, and new approaches to nature. Students will experience data generation using various quantitative and qualitative methodologies.\n\nYou will critically reflect upon the role of public relations in key environmental debates, problematise the power relations that constrain community interests and understand the value of public relations as a potential mechanism for advancing policy and socio-cultural change. Social media, as culturally constituted discursive spaces, offer alternative avenues for environmental public relations through a shift to participatory cultures and an opening up or reconfiguration of notions of the public interest. You will consider the implications of such shifts and the potential dynamics of public relations that play out during moments of controversy and crisis.

        "description": "In the capstone, you will consolidate your grasp of the discipline of philosophy by examining a pivotal text in the history of philosophy that (a) weighs in on the relation between the two main streams of the discipline (mind/metaphysics/epistemology and value theory); and (b) has been broadly influential upon contemporary philosophical debates and practices. The selected text may vary from semester to semester, but some representative examples would include: Spinoza\u2019s Ethics, Hume\u2019s Treatise of Human Nature, Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. The selected text will be examined with respect to: its historical context; its integrity as a unified and systematic work; the independent power of its arguments; the implications of these arguments for other areas of humanistic inquiry; and the enduring influence of the text over contemporary debates and philosophical practice. The practical apprenticeship of the subject will be developed by introducing students to the variety of research practices of the discipline and encouraging students to reflect upon those practices in the development of a sustained and integrated research project. \u00a0You will refine your skills for focused analytic writing that will serve you in a range of future career paths, both academic and non-academic.\u00a0\n",

This is manifested in the perceived excellence of French Haute Cuisine, born in the banquets of the Aristocracy and the Royal court in 17th century and in a culinary terminology that has conquered the world (ratatouille, patisserie, terroir). The tradition of French gastronomy is indeed an integral part of French identity that has been recognized in 2010 by the inclusion of the French gastronomic meal and its rituals in the list of intangible UNESCO cultural heritage. The behaviours and values associated with food and wine are an essential component of successful social and business interactions in France and other Francophone countries. They therefore constitute a rich entry into French culture that may facilitate future professional interactions and cultural sensitivity.\nThrough the viewing of films and documentaries, and the reading of literary texts and excerpts from the culinary genre (recipe books, dictionaries, essays, and guides), this course will allow you to discover the evolution of French society through its rich culinary tradition and compare it to your own society. You will explore varied culinary practices in the Francophone world and meet industry professionals who will explain how they navigate the challenges of globalisation, sustainability or foreign influence.\nEven though the language of instruction is English, you will be required to complete the assessments in French if you have selected to take this course as a professional elective.",

In less than half a century, a predominantly rural society has been transformed into a mainly urban and technological one. A 40-year dictatorship was supplanted by a strong, progressive democracy. One of the world&#39;s most centralised states has been made into one of the most decentralised. A society that was intensely sexually repressed has become a notably permissive one. There has been a revolution in the roles of men and women. Spain has experienced a surge in immigration that has turned the country, in the space of just a few years, into a multi-ethnic society. In this context of change, the topics explored in the course will include family, sexuality and gender, migration and ethnicity, identity, religion, animal rights, cultural appropriation, and popular culture.",

In the first phase, the course leads you to examine and discuss readings and visual materials presenting various aspects of the characteristics of the language. You refine and expand your knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, expressions, kanji, and different styles and registers in Japanese through interactive exercises in both lectures and tutorials. These practices provide you some hints and ideas to opt for your research topic. In the second phase, you prepare a project by exploring a specific area of Japanese you find interesting or useful. After practicing communication strategies and skills, a series of interview sessions for data collection give you opportunities to interact with your peers and native Japanese speakers. In the final phase, you write a paper and present it in Japanese. You use your analytical and critical thinking as well as presentation and academic writing skills. This course is taught in Japanese and with readings in Japanese.\n",

The course interrogates these and many more critical questions surrounding the community-based approach to development and environmental management. The course exposes you to a sophisticated understanding of the current development and environment issues affecting the well-being of local communities in Australia and developing countries. Specifically, the course provides you with the necessary\u00a0theoretical background as well as a set of case studies to understand and tackle real-world\u00a0environmental and development challenges. Through this course, you will have an opportunity to integrate\u00a0social, economic and environmental aspects of development and environmental issues, and the concepts are discussed through the lens of sustainable development from a societal perspective. Ideas and issues are presented as contested entities because of the multiplicity of diverse, and at times, diametrically opposed stakeholder interests. The approach of the course, therefore, eschews the \u201cone right way\u201d approach to development and environment management in favour of an approach based on understanding the diverse and complex societal contexts in which development and environment professionals operate. Different approaches to managing the environment and development projects and programs are illustrated throughout by means of relevant case studies. You will be able to explore whether and how different policies and practices are working (or not working), and how policy responses can be made more equitable and sustainable at the community level.\u00a0\n",

        "description": "Whether in public or academic discourse the notions of \u2018modernity\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019 are ubiquitous. Yet what they mean is often far from clear. They designate a period, which extends to our own present, but the terms also refer to a set of concepts and contentious issues. Chief among these are the ideas of novelty and innovation, of rationalisation and secularism, but also of critique and disillusionment. Narratives of progress and emancipation compete with more somber analyses, frequently tinged by a nostalgia for what has been lost in the modern age. Taking its cue from Max Weber\u2019s suggestion to think of the processes of modernisation as leading to the disenchantment of the world, the course looks at a series of prominent concepts that have been used to reflect on the idea of modernity and its implications. Readings will include the sociologist Max Weber on science, and on the Protestant ethic and capitalism; political theorists Carl Schmitt and Hannah Arendt on sovereignty, authority, and totalitarianism; the intellectual historian Reinhart Koselleck on the ideas of revolution and historical time; and the philosopher Peter Sloterdijk on the Nietzschean notion of \u2018ressentiment\u2019 \u2013 to name just a few.\n",

From the #metoo movement, to Black Lives Matter, to the Alt Right, to the Arab spring protests and\u00a0Occupy and Indignado movements: all around the world citizens are mobilising,\u00a0some because they want political change, others because they want to maintain the status quo.\u00a0What is change?

What kind\u00a0of change do political actors seek to achieve? In this course you will further explore these questions comparing processes of political change and actors involved in generating political change in Australia and other countries around the world. You will learn about the role of power, legitimacy, and insider and outsider positions in making political change work (or not). You will leave this course with a better understanding of what political change is, how it can be achieved, and what your own role can be in changing the world.\u00a0",

You will be asked to think carefully about complex and intractable questions of identity, collectivity, social justice and governance. You will interrogate how identities are experienced politically, and in particular contexts, and will draw on particular examples from throughout the world to examine how various politics of identity, including the scholarly and public debates they have provoked, have emerged to challenge dominant ideas about social justice. How are identity and belonging shaped in the contemporary world? How do so-called nation-states engage, or not, with the political claims of oppressed social groups? Should citizenship still be the foundation for addressing identity claims in democracies? Does a nation-state have a right to protect its \u2018national identity\u2019 through restrictive immigration policies? What is the relationship between nationalism, race and sexuality? How do the media and popular culture impact the political recognition of ethnicity, gender, class and culture? By exploring how identities are constituted and situated in today\u2019s highly mobile and interconnected world, you will make your own decisions about how these identities shape world politics and what, for you, are the most pressing questions therein.\u00a0\n\nSubject Area: Politics and International Relations,\n",

Over the last century, however, it has become institutionalised and professionalised and, as the disciplinary name Political Science suggests, has sought to put the study of politics on a footing comparable to the aims, methods, and conventions presumed integral to the natural sciences. Yet the possibility, desirability, and even meaning of a \u201cscience of politics\u201d are controversial issues. This course examines fundamental questions about what political knowledge is and how it is acquired the &#39;art&#39;, craft of political science, that can be learned, practiced and improved over times.\u00a0This goal is achieved by reading and engaging in careful study of several seminar works in contemporary political science. In almost every week, we study a well designed and effectively executed research work as an example of how the &#39;art&#39; of political science is practiced in various branches of the discipline, including normative, formal and empirical studies.\u00a0",

You will address the relationship between methods and methodology and recognise the importance of understanding the historical, theoretical and philosophical contexts from which particular research methods have emerged. Social researchers do not apply a set of neutral techniques to the issues they investigate, but rather research is part of a dynamic, engagement with social and cultural worlds with often deep connections to colonial thought and power. A heightened sense of the strategies used in researching culture and society enhances reflexivity among social researchers: that is, the capacity to reflect upon who we are, what we are doing; and the ethics of accountability. You will find that central to this course is the proposition that social research is a form of intervention in the social and cultural world, which may have major consequences on people\u2019s lives. So too you will develop an understanding of your \u2018subjective positioning\u2019 and will come to find ways to decolonise your practice both through methods and methodologies.

The course begins with an interdisciplinary focus on cultural theory in order to foster a field of conceptual commonalities across disciplinary boundaries. It then sees students break into disciplinary sub-groups to allow the debates within cultural theory to illuminate particular conceptual and analytical challenges internal to each discipline.",

This course builds on the general knowledge of aviation gained in first year and explores the design, technology and operations of baggage handling systems at airports.\u00a0\nThe course consists of three phases. The first phase introduces the baggage handling process and its operational aspects, in particular, the interactions between the different stages of the process. The second phase focuses on the latest developments in baggage handling systems technology and the changes made to the baggage handling process, such as the application of RFID and biometric technology. The last phase deals with design processes and system analyses. The Delft systems approach and design methods will be introduced to students, enabling them to analyse the baggage handling process and to conceptually design a baggage handling system.\u00a0\nThroughout the course, all aspects of baggage handling systems will be analysed from different perspectives: the designer of the overall system, the component supplier, the airport, the airline, customs and the passengers. The course concludes with two assignments that allow students to put the theory in practice.",

        "description": "Weight loss fads in the form of diets and exercise regimes (with mostly unrealistic claims) are ubiquitous in modern day life; however, there is surprising ignorance and confusion about how we lose weight, with most people unable to answer the simplest question: when you lose weight, where does the fat go? Popular (incorrect) answers include energy, heat, faeces and sweat. Surprisingly, this question has also baffled health professionals including general practitioners, dietitians and professional trainers. \nThis course will lift the veil on weight loss by tracing every atom you eat into and out of your body, and you will learn the fate of fat during weight loss, that is, it is converted to carbon dioxide and water and exits your body mainly through your lungs. Along the way, you will also learn how humans convert foods into useful energy, what exactly is happening in your bodies during weight loss and weight gain, and by the end you will be able to critically examine popular weight loss claims as well as your own diet and lifestyle. Diet myths and wellness nonsense topple like dominoes along the way. \nNo prior scientific knowledge is assumed as we aim to provide you with the knowledge to answer this big, fat myth.\n",

        "description": "Since the release of the first human genome about two decades ago, our understanding of genetics has improved significantly. Facilitated by massive developments in DNA sequencing technologies, we now live in a society where genetics and genomics, and applications thereof, have become household terms. We hear about genetically modified food crops with extra nutrients or drought resistance, and personalised medicine offers new hope (or hype) in health care. Genetic tools are routinely used in forensics and gene doping is a growing concern at sporting events. Synthetic biology promises new frontiers of technology, and the day we use DNA for data storage is not that far away.\nWhat does this all mean? Is it ethical? Is it legal? What are the social implications that come with these applications?\nThis interactive, fully online course will introduce students to fundamental genetic concepts using real life applications and implications of genetics while providing an opportunity to get hands-on experience in analysing and interpreting genetic data. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate the ethical, legal and social implications of genetic advances throughout the course. On completion, we anticipate the students will be better prepared to survive in the \u201cgenome generation\u201d and participate in informed debate and decision making with regard to incorporating genetic interventions in everyday life.",

A fundamental aim of synthetic biology is to make biology easier to engineer through the application of engineering principles and standardisation of biological components.\u00a0Central to this engineering is the deconstruction of biological systems into components (e.g. DNA, enzymes, genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, etc.) that can be uncoupled from each other, abstracted into predictable forms, characterised, and reassembled into novel functional systems to solve specific problems.\n\nThis course will give students insight into the assembly and design of interchangable biological parts that\u00a0form the basis of synthetic biology. Students will learn the methods for standardised assembly of DNA and genes into functioning devices, including biological circuits, DNA/RNA/protein nanostructures, and engineered organisms. A particular emphasis is placed on using online tutorials and computer labs to apply engineering principles for the design of a biological system, followed by wet labs to build and evaluate the biological function of the assemblages.\u00a0This design - build - test paradigm reinforces an understanding of how biological systems are not static processes to be memorised, but rather, dynamic systems which can be manipulated and built from the ground-up.\n\n\u00a0\n",

Students will learn to do that effectively in a digital age where the content is easily accessed but the understanding of that information is harder to achieve. They will also learn how to measure the effectiveness of their communication of science. Understanding the art of evidence based science communication has become more important than ever before in a world where fake science news threatens our ability to communicate science effectively. \nFor those students going on to a higher degree in science, a basic requirement of being a successful scientist is to be able to effectively communicate. However, very few scientists have had any formal evidence-based science communication education. Fewer still have been taught how new emerging communication technologies can engage audiences with science or how to use emotion and be personable when communicating science. This course prepares students for a career in their chosen science discipline.\nThe objective of BEES6800 is to help students to gain confidence in clearly communicating science and why it matters across multiple peer and public audiences in multiple modes, and via multiple digital technologies and media \u2013 including social media.\nThe course is fully online.\nAssessment will be through three connected online assignments that directly address course outcomes.These outcomes include understanding the nature and processes of science, being able to communicate science clearly with multiple audiences in multiple modes, understanding the best use of new and emerging technologies to communicate science, thinking critically and creatively, and knowing how to measure the effectiveness of science communication.\nThere is no final exam.\nStudents need 48 Units of Credit to take this science elective course. There is no assumed knowledge of science communication.\nStudents taking this course will be able to communicate effectively as scientists, and may find it useful if considering a career in science communication.\n\u00a0",

Weekly activities build capabilities in using ideation and innovation strategies to achieve more imaginative and human-focused outcomes. The course culminates with a &#39;sustainable innovation challenge&#39; that integrates the specialized skills of the cross-disciplinary student teams. In the teamwork that occurs, students are expected to contribute the unique insights, theories, methods, communication forms, and other prior skills from their own academic specialization, in order to enrich the learning of their teams as they cooperate and collaborate on assessment tasks.",

As well as the educational benefits of a course that produces a public resource of real social value, the focus on \u2018small data\u2019 skills addresses a weakness in the popular smart cities movement. Driven by the growth in computing power and big data sets, the smart cities movement often focuses on making use of available data, rather than developing new data sets.

The course will provide you with an introduction to the various statues that\napply to heritage within Australia and NSW. During the first half of the semester, we will cover the history of heritage\nconservation in Australia, including the ICOMOS Burra Charter, and how heritage is identified, assessed and\nmanaged at World, National, Commonwealth, and State and Local levels. Following mid-semester break, our focus\nshifts and we concentrate on different aspects of our heritage including; cultural landscapes, Aboriginal and settler\narchaeology, built heritage, cultural landscapes, interpretation and intangible values. Throughout the course you will\nlearn from experienced professionals working in the public and private sectors. They will present various disciplinary\nperspectives including archaeology, architecture and landscape architecture. The guest lecturers will talk about their\n\u2018real life\u2019 experience of working in heritage in the context of the legislation and urban development in Sydney and\nelsewhere.\n\nDrawing on this professional experience, the course will canvass some of the different approaches to understanding\nheritage and conservation. Many of these approaches are political and official, involving governments at international,\nnational, state and local levels. They are also formal and involve statutory planning processes such as identification,\nassessment, listing via planning instruments and heritage registers, and provisions for permits and applications. In\neach case, the approaches, solutions and outcomes for heritage projects vary based on political will, economic\nissues, the formal protective mechanisms, professional judgments, subjectivity and community values.\nThe primary aim of the course is to ensure that as future professionals in the fields of urban planning, architecture and\nlandscape architecture, you develop a sound understanding of the theoretical, legislative, administrative and practical\naspects of heritage conservation that is grounded in \u2018real world experience\u2019. This, in turn, will enable you to gain an\nunderstanding of how heritage and the values attributed to it change through time and reflect how we see ourselves\nas a nation, a state, a community and as individuals.\n",

With the low housing affordability in Sydney it is of paramount importance that the students of architecture, interior architecture, construction, planning and landscape architecture are introduced to models of affordable housing that are accessible to the majority of the city\u2019s population. The BEIL6007 International Engagement Housing in Vienna course takes the students to the city of Vienna where more than 60% of the city\u2019s population lives in some form of subsidized apartments. The Viennese model of affordable housing is built on a diverse definition of social and affordable housing that includes city-owned flats and limited profit housing co-operatives.\n\nThe Housing in Vienna course is offered to a maximum number of 25 students currently enrolled in third year Architectural Studies and Master of Architecture and Planning, and third and fourth year in Interior Architecture, Construction, Landscape, and Planning. The course takes place at the Technical University of Vienna where UNSW students collaborate with local students and practitioners.\n",

This on-field research will be used as \u2018evidence\u2019 to create an urban design proposal in response to a real-world challenge observed in the street. The proposal will contribute to resilient, inclusive, and vital public space.\nPhnom Penh streets are clear examples of diverse urban dwellers appropriating the public domain. In many Sydney streets, this kind of informal or unplanned activity is less apparent. What knowledge can be exchanged in comparing these contexts? How can we use interdisciplinary and intercultural collaboration to expand our understanding? How can we draw from both the formal and informal dynamics of street space? How might we, as designers, use observational research to meaningfully contribute to place-making?\nwww.streetlifestudies.wordpress.com.",

We will take into consideration current practice, particularly perceived problems, such as the alienating nature of many recent design projects. These prompt an inquiry into past principles that demand our attention now. Historical achievements are reinterpreted, with the aim of stimulating alternative design strategies.\n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans are discussed, because their writings influenced designers in later epochs. A tradition of thinking about design stressed the significance of topics, such as order, proportion, analogy, symmetry, decorum, economy, ornament, the profile of mouldings, the angle of view, rhythmic measure, empathy, memory, monumentality and the play of light.\n\nEmphasis is placed on the analogy between a person and a design. This involves the theory of a human being as a \u2018type\u2019, whose constitution accords with built forms. Analysis of this accentuates human characteristics and actions, which are associated with privileged forms. The history of design thinking offers insight into a human being, who feels an affinity with a city, street, building and room, as well as the fundamental elements of a column, door, window, ornament, chair and door handle.\n",

Tutorials will be based upon residential project work. Lectures will cover both the theoretical and practical definitions of &#39;detailing&#39; as a language and will be supplemented by lectures covering current residential techniques of documentation and developing building contract documentation to support successful building outcomes. The program is fast paced and requires the production of a consistent documentation package. Completion of a resolved and consistent documentation package requires research, identification and resolution of design construction issues. To enable students to achieve the required level of documentation skill, within the semester, and experience current professional working processes, all course work will be done in groups. Students need to be able to establish a process and commitment, for group work.\nNote: This Built Environment elective course is best suited to students with a practical use and understanding of CAD software plus the language of documentation (technical drawing skills including plans, sections and elevations).",

This course will provide you with the appropriate background theory and knowledge of therapeutic bionic devices used to treat a range of disorders such as the ones mentioned above. This course will also provide you with the knowledge of how these devices interact with the human nervous system to induce a therapeutic effect through a process called neuromodulation.\u00a0 By the end of the course you should have a fundamental understanding of the important factors that dictate the success or failure of such devices as well as the important factors surrounding their design. You should also be qualified to advise on the choices available for a given therapeutic application and the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative. Finally, you should also learn how the \u201cbiology\u201d i.e. our own bodies interact with these artificial devices and challenges on how to make devices safe and effective. A key element of this course is that you will get to learn first-hand from lecturers who are involved in the research and development of these devices both at UNSW and in the industry sector from two of Australia\u2019s leading companies, Cochlear Limited and Saluda Medical. You will also get to hear views from the end users of some of these devices.\n",

Even many plants in Australia are venomous and have a deadly sting. \u00a0The Australian environment provides many deadly challenges to its visitors. However, aside from simply having a reputation as being a dangerous place the characteristics which make the Australian flora and fauna so distinctive and the reasons why it is so distinctive are poorly understood by most people.\nIn this course students will learn about how evolutionary isolation has made the Australian fauna and flora so distinct. Along the way students will learn about the deadly animals and plants of Australia and how to identify them. Students will also learn about why this long period of isolation has made the Australian fauna so vulnerable to the threats posed by introduced species. This course will involve some day trip excursions and will incur a small cost to students (approximately $100). ",

Unfortunately, only a small proportion of people ever gain more than a superficial understanding of natural selection and how evolution works. And that can be problematic given the important insights that evolution provides into the most difficult and persistent problems that plague 21st Century living, including antibiotic resistance, obesity, overpopulation, income inequality, gender inequity and the ideological warfare that surround sex and family life.\n\u00a0This course introduces students from all areas of the university to the power of evolutionary thinking, and how to use it responsibly to understand modern life and the controversial issues that inhere to it. In addition to introducing the original - often counterintuitive - insights evolution provides, we explore the relationships between evolutionary, social, cultural and economic processes.\nLearning involves on 2-hour lecture per week, plus a 1.5-2 hour workshop in which we will explore evolution using custom-designed video games and other interactive resources and data.\nAssessment comprises three quizzes and an essay.

Students will also take the course with students and staff from Arizona State University and Kings College London as part of the PLuS Alliance\u00a0with UNSW. We will also have lectures from researchers from the Okavango River Institute, part of the University of Botswana. The Okavango Delta has extensive wetland systems with diverse waterbird populations, vegetation communities, the largest population of elephants in Africa and large predators, including lions and leopards. This diverse ecosystem lies at the end of\u00a0one of the world&#39;s last few large free-flowing rivers. This course will involve non-government and government managers involved in practical concepts of river basin ecosystem conservation, management and governance. Students will acquire an advanced understanding of the politics, governance and management of river basin ecosystem science by unpacking the geopolitical constraints and considerations shaping the Delta&#39;s management. It receives most of its water from Angola with the Okavango River, which then\u00a0flows through Namibia to Botswana. Participants\u00a0will gain skills in field methods,\u00a0ecosystem scale landscape analyses and their application to human/wildlife interactions. They will contribute to long-term collection of data for the management of the river basin. The overall aim of the course is to tackle a global challenge in a developing country of the world, focusing on sustainability of biological and abiotic processes within the context of human drivers of development. It uses the Okavango River Delta as a case study but compares this to Australian systems, particularly the Lake Eyre Basin.

It involves air conditioning and mechanical ventilation, electrical light and power, fire services, fire safety engineering, water and waste services, data and communications, security and access control, vertical transportation, and acoustics.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEffective management of building services is indispensable for the operation and usage of buildings, for example, certain types of buildings such as hospitals are almost 100% dependent on electrical, ventilating and air conditioning services and any ineffectiveness will cause serious disruptions to its users and may even lead to loss of lives. The management of the installation and maintenance of services within a building spans over the lifecycle of a building, unlike some trades that occur at the construction stage only.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTherefore, skills and knowledge about different building services and their management are essential for any construction manager, project manager or facilities manager. Hence, BLDG2011 Building Services has been made a core course within the degree program. Building services is &#34;the practice of the art and science of engineering for achieving optimal integrated building systems incorporating environmental control and safety provisions for the comfort and wellbeing of the occupants of the built environment&#34;.\n\n\u00a0\n",

Project risk management is an iterative process and assists organisations in setting strategy, achieving objectives and informed decision making during project lifecycle, from initiation to completion.\n\nIn alignment with industry standards and recommended practices, this course provides guidance on the selection and application of techniques for assessing risks and uncertainties in a wide range of situation. The techniques are used to assist in making decisions where there is uncertainty, to provide information about particular risks and as part of a process for managing risk. The course provides summaries of a range of techniques and methodologies, with references to other documents where the techniques are described in more detail. In addition, through review of some common risk assessment tools and business analytics, including Palisade &#64;Risk software and Office Microsoft Project (MSP), the course helps students to learn and practice how risk assessment techniques and business analytics can drive smarter engineering and construction risk-based decisions during project development and delivery phases.\n",

Empirical dynamic modelling techniques for both continuous and discrete time models are covered.  The fundamental concepts of feedback/feedforward control are introduced, following by a an overview of process instrumentation and the heuristic process control rules and schemes for typical process units.  Quantitative control design is then introduced suing the example of PID control.  The concept of and conditions on control system stability and the control performance design are discussed. The model based control methods are presented including internal model control, direct synthesis and control design based on frequency response. More advanced control topics including cascade control, multiloop control, batch process control and digital control complete the course. The students will be familiarized with the numerical stimulation and computer aided control design environment by the extensive use of MATLAB/Simulink software. Laboratory components are designed to help students understand the control theory and familiarize themselves with the typical process control equipment. This course replaces CHEN3070 and CHEN4070.

Sometimes these investigations occur on the desktop (e.g. researching design options, simulating processes or developing techno-economic models). Other investigations involve the collection and analysis of data from natural phenomena, equipment or product testing, or process operations. As professional chemical engineers you will be called upon to lead, plan and execute engineering projects investigating opportunities for process development and improvement. It&#39;s our bread and butter.\nIn this course you will develop and extend your skills in designing and executing experimental investigations of chemical engineering problems using small pilot-scale unit operations and analytical equipment. You will work in a team to conduct and document three experimental projects. Each team in your class will complete a different set of projects; however, they are all designed to achieve the same learning outcomes. The experimental projects in this course have an open-ended nature and will require you to plan and execute laboratory work over one or two lab sessions in consecutive weeks.\nThis course will further develop your skills in analysis, critical thinking, communication, project management and teamwork. This will be achieved through preparing and presenting an experimental proposal, collaborating in laboratory environment to execute your plan, and documenting and reflecting on your results in a technical report. Direct feedback will be provided the demonstrator in charge of your experimental project, with additional feedback and grades provided online. The course concludes with a seminar where each team will reflect on their learning over the term.",

        "description": "Research Thesis Extension is an inquiry-based learning course that allows students to deepen and/or broaden the scope of their thesis project. It is particularly recommended to students considering a research career and/or pursuing a research degree (such as a PhD). This course provides an authentic experience of the higher degree environment through the supervisor-student relationship, and the focus of assessment on developing a draft journal paper.\nAs in other the Research Thesis courses, the project a student undertakes must be a complex, open-ended problem that allows room for creativity, and the acquisition, analysis and interpretation of results. There must be multiple possible solutions or conclusions at the outset and sufficient complexity to require a degree of project planning from the student. The project will require students to bring together discipline knowledge and principles learned through academic study and professional experience. Students apply these principles to innovatively solve problems such as the development of a specific design, process and/or the investigation of a hypothesis.\nSince this course expands the scope of your original thesis project (planned in CEIC4951 and refined in CEIC4952), you cannot take this course at the same as CEIC4951 or CEIC4952. Students normally take this course at the same time as CEIC4953 or in the following term. To enrol in this course students normally need to have a WAM of at least 75, as well as the approval of your project supervisor and the course coordinator. Apart from in exceptional circumstances, students should continue with the same supervisor and project as they had in CEIC4951, CEIC4952 and CEIC4953.",

This course builds on the fundamental chemical principles learned in first year, exploring many of the central reactions that form the basis of living processes, modern research, and contemporary industrial transformations.\u00a0 The course contains a problem-based module on the application of spectroscopic methods to organic structure elucidation, focusing on infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Several modules then develop knowledge of major classes of organic reactions (including compounds containing alkenes, alkynes, aromatic rings, and carbonyl groups) by enriching a study of key reactions with an understanding of relevant reaction mechanisms. The concepts of reactivity and selectivity in the manipulation of more complex compounds will be highlighted, with an emphasis on biologically relevant molecules. Interleaved throughout the course will be relevant examples from contemporary chemical industries, and important medicinal and pharmaceutical examples.",

Case studies will include: viscometers, transpiration cooling, free convection heat transfer, simultaneous heat and mass transfer, evaporative cooling, drying, mass transfer with chemical reaction, etc. Multidimensional and transient problems will be covered, as will those involving compressible flows, non-newtonian flows and turbulence modelling.\nMost analysis nowadays involves the use of numerical software. Therefore, an introduction to the numerical solution of partial differential equations will be given, followed by the use of commercial numerical software such as COMSOL to solve practical problems.\nTextbooks:\nBird, Stewart and Lightfoot, Transport Phenomena, 2nd Edition.

For instance, you will learn about the ozone hole, the greenhouse effect, how to use charts to determine the likelihood of storms developing, why deserts occur at certain latitudes, and how to use the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s radar images on its website to track thunderstorms. This course will also train students in how to apply basic principles of physics and mathematics (including calculus) to real-world problems and situations.

The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application. \nThe course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns. Whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application, this is not the focus of the course, which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces.\u00a0",

Ideally, one would want to design algorithms that solve each instance exactly and in polynomial time. But since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any NP-hard problem, we will relax these requirements and design algorithms that either do not solve the problem exactly, that only solve a subset of instances, or whose worst-case running time is super-polynomial in the input size or some other parameter of the input.\n\nAmong algorithms that do not solve the problem exactly, we discuss heuristics and approximation algorithms. Heuristics do not guarantee to compute optimal solutions but tend to work well in practice. Approximation algorithms give additional guarantees of the quality of computed solution as compared to the optimal solution.\n\nAmong algorithms that only solve a subset of instances, we discuss graph classes where NP-hard graph problems often become polynomial-time solvable when the input is restricted to these classes.\n\nAmong algorithms that do not run in polynomial time, we discuss exponential-time algorithms and parameterized algorithms. In exponential-time algorithms we discuss algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case. In parameterized algorithms, a parameter k is associated with each instance and the goal is to design algorithms whose worst-case running time is fast whenever k is small. We will also see lower bounds for problems and how to rule out certain running times under various complexity assumptions.\n",

We will hear from criminalised people with disability, as well as leading advocates and practitioners working in the field. A key aim of the course is to develop a nuanced understanding of how disability as a key analytic category and identity (alongside class, race and gender/sexuality) is central to developing a deeper understanding of the functions, purpose and consequences of criminal justice systems. A related aim is to explore how this knowledge contributes to the development of alternatives to criminal justice that are rooted in the principles of social, restorative and transformative justice.",

It begins by considering the growing use of prisons across the developed world and is then constructed around three main themes: theorising the prison; perspectives for reform; and contemporary issues in Australian penal policy. The elective is designed to give students some insight into the frameworks used by social theorists to analyse imprisonment, with a view to examining contemporary issues such as \u2018supermax\u2019 prisons, deaths in custody, immigration detention, the civil rights of prisoners and prison privatisation. The experience of the New South Wales prison system following the 1978 Royal Commission into New South Wales prisons provides an immediate context for studying such issues and an opportunity to examine the complexities and limitations of prison reform.The course intends to focus on the wider sociological implications of imprisonment and to introduce students to the various perspectives on punishment and the prison system offered by social theorists. It is designed to encourage both a basic understanding of the core literature and the ability to apply different penological perspectives to original research.\nA student who has successfully completed this course should be able to:understand some of the main themes within penology; understand the relationship of penology to criminology; appreciate the wider instrumental role of the prison in the criminal justice process; and contribute to more informed policy debate about prisons and punishment.",

Those in contact with the justice system endure some of the worst health outcomes in the community in terms of mental illness, substance misuse, traumatic brain injury and infectious diseases (e.g. HIV and viral hepatitis). Many of these can be attributed to the social determinants of health and lifestyle factors including injecting drug use, alcohol abuse, sexual risk behaviours, body piercing, tattooing and violence. Contact with the justice system, including incarceration, presents an important opportunity to intervene and improve health outcomes of hard-to-access populations.\n\nSignificant overlap exists between public health and criminology in terms of offender rehabilitation as the criminogenic needs of this population are also public health priorities that operate in a complex legal, human rights, research, and policy environment.\n\nIn this course you will learn about the complex health needs of those in contact with the justice system and the importance of these for offender rehabilitation. Experts in this field (e.g. a former prisoner, prison administrator, prison doctor and prisoner support worker) will present and discuss the challenges and controversies in prisoner and offender health (e.g. harm reduction strategies in prison, treatment of the mentally ill in the justice system), researching offenders, ethical dilemmas, health service delivery in prison, and prevention and intervention strategies. A visit to a prison will provide an opportunity to reflect on some of these issues.\n",

The course will make students appreciate there is more to design than analysis and following codes, and that it is a creative and innovative process. Many parts of the civil and environmental engineering curriculums involve students learning mechanistic and law-like solutions to problems, guided by text books and design standards. This type of problem solving is important. But it is just as important for students to be creative and innovative in their problem solving. Rapid urbanisation around the world means problems are becoming more complex and unexpected requiring solutions for which text books and design standards are of limited use.\u00a0",

Needs for optimization of maintenance costs, objective and science-based inspection practices, increase of safety, emergence of new and improved construction materials and methods, new developments in measurement, sensing, processing and monitoring, as well as recent technological developments in various branches of science and engineering led to creation of relatively new, interdisciplinary branch of engineering \u2013 Structural Health Monitoring. SHM examines the use of low-cost, long term monitoring systems to keep civil infrastructure under constant surveillance, ensuring structural integrity. It has received great deal of attention all over the world due to its significant impact on safety and longevity of the structures.\u00a0\nThis subject provides an introduction and motivation of SHM with a systematic approach to SHM process. It introduces the topics with basic definitions of measurement and monitoring, various available and emerging monitoring technologies, data acquisition systems and instrumentation, passive and active sensing technologies. The course will cover the principal methods used for local non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and global vibration based SHM techniques. Overview of signal processing basics, feature extraction and a comprehensive list of comparative features will be addressed. Brief overview of structural dynamics will be presented. The students will be provided with hands-on experience in experimental and operational modal analysis, and will learn with structural properties extraction from data. Basics on data interpretation and analysis for both static and dynamic monitoring are presented. It will also introduce students to the concepts of statistical pattern recognition, machine learning, artificial intelligence and neural network and demonstrate the application of these technologies to SHM. Techniques based on data-driven approach and model-based approach to develop SHM solutions are presented. Techniques of combining finite element modelling and field measurements for realistic loading simulations and spatial extrapolation of measured data are discussed and finally, real-world applications and current state of the technology are discussed.

Post-pornography refers to the politics of embodiment in the context of post-humanism, a moment in which sex is understood beyond &#39;natural&#39; biology and reproductive futurity.\n\nEach week, representations of the body will be considered according to a different set of concepts and frameworks. Issues of identity, technology and power will be discussed alongside examples from contemporary art and culture.

A good engineer has complex technical skills, but also creative skills, project management and teamworking skills, and knowledge of professional ethical standards in design.\u00a0\nDESN2000 aims to further develop your skills in engineering design with a particular focus on the early stages, where innovative concepts are created in response to open-ended problems. These skills will be developed in the context of an engineering project, with a focus on three areas: (1) research techniques needed to understand design problems and discover concepts, (2) technical skills needed to build a concept, and (3) evaluation methods for evaluating the concept. Alongside the development of design skills, the course also aims to develop your readiness for professional practice by deepening your understanding and skills in effective project management, teamwork and communication.\nThe course builds on the teamwork, communication, and project management skills introduced in DESN1000. Skills learned in DESN2000 are further deepened in DESN3000, which will develop skills for managing design in commercial context.\nWith DESN1000 and DESN3000, DESN2000 provides design skills described in Engineers Australia\u2019s Stage 1 Competencies, especially competencies 1.3, 1.5, 1.6; 2., 2.3; and 3.2 and 3.6.\nStudents who require DESN2000 should enrol in a specific term according to their Engineering Specialisation:\nTerm 2:Students with specialisations offered by the School of Electrical Engineering and TelecommunicationsStudents with specialisations offered by the School of Civil and Environmental EngineeringStudents with specialisations offered by the School of Computer Science and Engineering\nTerm 3:Students with specialisations offered by the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing EngineeringStudents with specialisations offered by the School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy EngineeringStudents with specialisations offered by the School of Chemical EngineeringStudents with specialisations offered by the School of Minerals and Energy Resources Engineering\nPrerequisite Conditions:\nSchool of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering: (DESN1000 or DPST1071) and enrolled in an MME streams (AEROAH, MECHAH, MANFAH, MTRNAH)School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications: (DESN1000 or DPST1071) and ELEC2141 and (COMP1511 or COMP1521)School of Chemical Engineering: (DESN1000 or DPST1071) and CEIC2000 and (CHEM1821 or CHEM1021 or CHEM1041)\u00a0School of Civil and Environmental Engineering: (DESN1000 or DPST1071) and enrolled in a Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering streams (CVENAH, CVENBH, GMATDH)School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering: (DESN1000 or DPST1071) and SOLA 2051School of Computer Science and Engineering: (COMPBH and COMP1521 and (DESN1000 or DPST1071)) or (SENGAH/BINFAH and COMP 2521 and (DESN1000 or DPST1071))School of Minerals and Energy Resources Engineering: (MINEAH and (DESN1000 or DPST1071)) or (PETRAH and CEIC2001 and (DESN1000 or DPST1071))",

        "description": "Over the last three decades design innovation has become strategic: success in design requires a strategy for managing the broader problems of innovation. As design has gained importance, it also has become relevant to a wide array of stakeholders. This has added complexity to the way in which design should be undertaken.\nDesign is an important instrument of innovation in manufacturing and service industries, as well as in public, semi-public and humanitarian organizations. These environments set many types of requirements for innovation, including price points, brand requirements, competition, technological and brand legacies, government regulations, and ethics. They almost always require an analysis of the ethical environment, which is often but not always coded into professional rules and regulations.\nThese environments are usually ambiguous, dynamic and reactive, and designers cannot control them. To innovate in these environments, designers need strategies for identifying and managing these contextual requirements.\nDESN3000 teaches you skills in strategic design innovation. These include: skills for capturing the boundary conditions that create conditions for innovation; skills for creating design concepts that provide a fit to the strategic environment; skills for creating innovation strategies that help them to innovate in with multiple stakeholders who often have conflicting values and shifting interests; skills for identifying ethical problems involved in design decisions; and skills for managing teams and projects in strategic context.",

Topics covered include but are not limited to media ownership and regulation; the media and society; the media and politics; the media and social movements; the politics of spin; censorship, freedom of speech/press; new media and democracy; global media and global politics. Australian cases and their comparison with other national/global material will be used throughout.",

The ways in which we imagine data as well as the data objects themselves have a profound impact on the ways in which the world is organised, how resources are distributed, how we understand recent events and what we come to know as \u201cfact\u201d versus mere \u201copinion\u201d. In this course you will learn to both produce and critically analyse data objects. In addition to practicing data extraction, analysis and visualisation, you will learn how to evaluate the multiple examples of data that you encounter \u201cin the wild\u201d \u2013 data that are used by the media, by governments and civil society to explain and organise the world around you. By the end of the course, you will have gained a solid introduction to the processes involved in working with data and an ability to reflect on current debates about the impact of data on society.",

They will learn to think the way that engineers think, coming up with good solutions to problems despite being limited by budget, time and resources, the requirement to also meet environmental and social objectives and of course the limitations of the laws of physics. This will help them to appreciate the central ideas of engineering design as an on-time, on-budget and fit for purpose solution to a poorly specified, open-ended problem. They will be assigned to a team to work over a ten week period to solve a practical problem. The project on offer will change from year to year. In doing all this they will start to build key skills for engineers that will be called upon repeatedly in their academic and professional lives, including concept development, critical thinking and evaluation skills, clear communication, research and information literacy skills and the skills involved in successfully functioning within a team environment to complete a given task.\n",

We shall discuss the advantages and disadvantages of experimental methods relative to other empirical social science methods such as econometrics, and will document how it can be used to explore the robustness of the &#34;homo economicus&#34; assumption of a rational, selfish decision maker used in many economic models. We will find that economic theory does a good job in many applications but that there are also important behavioural deviations from the model of \u201chomo economicus\u201d.

This course discusses a range of analytical methods that may cluster analysis, regression, model selection and regularisation, regression trees, cross-validation, the bootstrap and natural experiments with an emphasis on applications in a data rich environment. The relative strengths and interaction of these methods will be explored across three types of tasks: description, prediction and counterfactual prediction. The distinction between experimental and observational data will be stressed and there may be discussion of less traditional types of data structures such as textual, spatial and network data.",

At that scale, the laws of Quantum Mechanics become important. For classical electronics, an understanding of quantum phenomena and their impact on nanoscale devices is essential to further improve their performance. On the other hand, quantum effects can also be deliberately harnessed and exploited to create unprecedented functionalities.\nThe course &#34;Fundamentals of Quantum Engineering&#34; provides a modern, accessible, engineering-oriented introduction to the laws of Quantum Mechanics, and their relevance and applications in the emerging field of quantum technologies. The course teaches Quantum Mechanics using a matrix-oriented approach, which allows the students to write simple computer code to simulate the behaviour of surprisingly complex quantum devices.\nThe key learning outcomes of the course is the ability to understand and quantitatively describe the behaviour of quantum mechanical systems and devices, and to appreciate the potential of quantum phenomena to be applied for the construction of revolutionary systems such as quantum computers, quantum-enhanced sensors, and secure quantum communication channels. The course has a rather minimal set of prerequisities, and provides the necessary knowledge base to attend more advanced courses on the theory and applications of Quantum Mechanics. ",

The course material is advanced in nature, due to its interdisciplinary content, its delivery in an intensive mode, and the breadth of topics covered. Hence, students taking this course must have the skills\u00a0of an Honours level graduate engineer such that they\u00a0are capable of undertaking self-directed reading and learning in engineering systems, performing individual research, and have the required maths and engineering skills.",

The course begins with the different ways in which companies can be structured and the differing types of ownership that exist. Thereafter, the principles and applications of financial mathematics are introduced and used to value securities and investment decisions. Portfolio theory is used to provide a foundation for determining the relationship between expected risk and returns in financial and real asset investments. Dividend payouts and the choices between debt and equity financing, including methods of determining the cost of capital, are also covered. Further, this course includes analysis of the influence of the capital market environment, the implications of financial risk, taxation and the conflict of interest between managers and investors on the value and operation of businesses. The course develops distinct conceptual frameworks and specialised tools for solving real-world financial problems at both the personal and corporate level. Illustrations from real-life corporate practices are used to highlight the importance and relevance of financial management to the realisation of personal and corporate financial objectives. Examples include personal financial planning, funds management, capital raisings, portfolio selection of financial securities, private equity, public floats and the pricing of assets in the stock market.",

Course topics encompass (i) econometric theory and methods, (ii) data collection and management, and (iii) programming. The course establishes a unified framework for analysing three econometric methods (least squares regression, maximum likelihood, and generalised method of moments). These econometric methods are applied to topics in corporate finance and asset pricing. The data section of the course covers appropriate use of database management systems, such as SAS and SQL. Programming is taught using general-purpose languages so that students learn how to write structured, modular program design. Programming examples are geared towards solving common problems in Financial research. Throughout the course, specific topics are selected to reflect student&#39;s interests.\u00a0",

        "description": "This undergraduate course is specifically aimed at either fourth year students or other students with a maths/programming background. It critically evaluates models of financial markets (market microstructure) and examines how asset prices are established in actual markets such as the stock exchange based on actual trades.\u00a0 It differs from asset pricing theory in which prices are assumed to be set such that supply and demand are equated via some costless auction-type frictionless mechanism that remains an undisclosed \u2018black box\u2019. Actual markets require actual rules and these rules affect the way in which prices are established, the way in which information possessed by traders is incorporated into asset prices, why some markets and stocks are liquid and why some markets are more fragile and costly than others.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile this course is based on an excellent text by three leading lights in the field, it is supplemented by a number of state-of-the-art studies that significantly advance our understanding of the role of different types of risk-volatility and illiquidity-in determining asset prices and the equity premium, for example, why it is that households can outperform professional investors?, how information contained in the stock price enables boards and CEOs to be monitored, and the role of counterparty transparency in improving market efficiency. Many of these papers are written by or with former students in the course.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt first presents the basic modelling and tools used in the market microstructure field which analyses how prices are established in securities markets and whether or not markets are liquid. The course then analyses components of market design such as transparency and fragmentation (maker-taker fee structures and inverted markets, how investor heterogeneity leads to the (false?) rejection of asset pricing models, and how market design affects asset prices and corporate performance.\u00a0\nThis market microstructure course helps to address many of these fundamental issues, as well as equip students to read, understand and apply the rapidly developing market microstructure field in areas such as merchant banking.\u00a0\nThe goal of the course is to establish perspectives, approaches, tools and methods of independent thinking, analysis, and problem solving. Topics include exchange design rules, transparency and opacity, asymmetric information, private information, liquidity provision and pricing, volatility, transaction costs, strategic and noise trading, algorithmic trading, information and trading profits, dark pools, liquidity and returns. Three groups of traders are considered: domestic and foreign institutions and households. Households can be clients of either \u2018full-service\u2019 brokers or \u2018discount\u2019 brokers.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis course complements courses in asset pricing that students may have done or be doing. Analysis of microstructure is also becoming increasingly relevant for research in other areas such as corporate finance.",

In this course you will examine the development, the science, and the place of food in society so you can engage in these contemporary debates about the future of food.\nSociety\u2019s attitudes and understanding of the role that food plays in our health has been rapidly changing in the last decade. Existing food hierarchies have been overturned and diet orthodoxies disrupted. We are learning more and more how changes to diet can promote or discourage chronic disease like diabetes, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s. At the same time, we are increasingly aware of the way that food production, packaging, and distribution is impacting the environment and contributing to climate change. This leads many to consider the ethics of food creation and consumption.\nThis course will give you insights into the breadth and depth of food science - a rapidly evolving discipline. The course will introduce you to some of the common scientific principles, practices, and challenges related to our food systems. You will examine the interactions between the food industry and consumer ethics, health, and behaviour. Finally, you will consider the arguments around food packaging and the role of innovation in food product development, food waste and sustainability.",

Some say that space mining is the way to create a society of limitless resources and change the way that the world can operate, others say that mining space resources will cause crashes in gold, platinum and multiple other markets, creating havoc here on Earth. Issues like these are why subjects like space mining are in need of people from other disciplines, to help understand all of the other problems in this and similar fields and how those problems might be solved.\nIn this course, we will explore what opportunities this and other world-changing engineering challenges have for those who are not engineers.

This course focuses on how\u00a0the law\u00a0must constantly\u00a0adapt and undergo renewal in order to meet the changing needs of society while also maintaining continuities within the legal tradition. This means that not every pressure group can be accommodated, not everyone&#39;s values in a pluralistic society can be equally respected without sacrificing certain Australian values and beliefs. Ultimately it will be Australian legal institutions, the federal, state and territory legislatures which decide how to effect these changes and the courts which provide judicial oversight of the laws made by the legislatures.",

Popular (incorrect) answers include energy, heat, faeces and sweat. Surprisingly, this question has also baffled health professionals including general practitioners, dietitians and professional trainers. \nThis course will lift the veil on weight loss by tracing every atom you eat into and out of your body, and you will learn the fate of fat during weight loss, that is, it is converted to carbon dioxide and water and exits your body mainly through your lungs. Along the way, you will also learn how humans convert foods into useful energy, what exactly is happening in your bodies during weight loss and weight gain, and by the end you will be able to critically examine popular weight loss claims as well as your own diet and lifestyle. Diet myths and wellness nonsense topple like dominoes along the way. \nNo prior scientific knowledge is assumed as we aim to provide you with the knowledge to answer this big, fat myth.\nNote: Students enrolled in a Faculty of Science program should not take this course but can enrol in the equivalent course, BABS1111.\u00a0",

Facilitated by massive developments in DNA sequencing technologies, we now live in a society where genetics and genomics, and applications thereof, have become household terms. We hear about genetically modified food crops with extra nutrients or drought resistance, and personalised medicine offers new hope (or hype) in health care. Genetic tools are routinely used in forensics and gene doping is a growing concern at sporting events. Synthetic biology promises new frontiers of technology, and the day we use DNA for data storage is not that far away.\nWhat does this all mean? Is it ethical? Is it legal? What are the social implications that come with these applications?\nThis interactive, fully online course will introduce students to fundamental genetic concepts using real life applications and implications of genetics while providing an opportunity to get hands-on experience in analysing and interpreting genetic data. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate the ethical, legal and social implications of genetic advances throughout the course.

        "description": "Imagine a world of wildly escalating temperatures, apocalyptic flooding, devastating storms and catastrophic sea level rise. This might sound like a prediction for the future or the storyline of a new Hollywood blockbuster but it is something quite different: it\u2019s our past. When we\u2019re bombarded with worrying forecasts for the future, it seems hard to believe that such things could come to pass. Yet almost everywhere we turn, the landscape is screaming out that the world is a capricious place. But if we don\u2019t tune in, the message is lost. In a day and age of environmental crises, we need to urgently decipher the past and learn from it.\nThis next decade will be a period of profound change. Under pressure from accelerating decline in the state of the environment, the world in the 2020s will be when the impacts of climate change sadly become all too apparent. The enormity of what society faces is deeply alarming. It is in this next decade that radical transformations must be achieved at an unprecedented scale if we are to have any hope of meeting the international agreements set out by the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement and United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThere is an urgent need for graduates who can work across different disciplines and timescales; who can bring ideas together to help find solutions. Past environmental changes provide valuable insights into how our planet works and what this means for the future. The aim of this course is to provide you with a critical understanding of environmental changes and their impacts. Over the ten weeks we will delve into some of the great scientific and archaeological questions about what happened when...and why it matters. And to achieve this we will provide you with a range of key skills and capabilities for the future, regardless of whether you pursue a career in science or not.\nGEOS3761 is delivered as a blended course. As a result, the content is provided through a combination of online material (including short films, quizzes and virtual field trips) and face-to-face practicals (with the option to take the latter online). The course has a Moodle Discussion Forum which provides an opportunity for you to engage with everyone on the course, supported by optional, informal one-hour sessions, where we will be discussing recent environmental stories in the news and answering any questions you might have.\n\u00a0",

You will work with a selection of authentic NSW Aboriginal language material from State Library of NSW collections. In doing so, you will have hands-on experience in how to find and utilise rich archival linguistic material and the ethical practices in the management and use of Aboriginal language materials. You will take away from this course a deepened understanding of social and cultural diversity as seen through the lens of language, analytical methods and critical thinking skills, and knowledge of research ethics and intellectual integrity.",

The overall approach to cybersecurity management taken is that of risk management. While risk management cannot eliminate all cybersecurity issues, IS contingency plans can help mitigate and control damage to IS assets. The overarching means of data protection in all organisations is via strong data governance design and frameworks. Without proper governance structure, the data attributes of cybersecurity cannot be maintained. Lastly, you also learn about emerging technological trends that places increasing emphases on cybersecurity management and governance.",

        "description": "This is an intermediate (Level 2) Information Systems (IS) course. In this course, you will examine the basic concepts and tools of supply chain management within the broader framework of an organisation&#39;s overall competitive strategy. The supply chain, which comprises all aspects of the sourcing of inputs from upstream suppliers, the internal value-adding processes and the distribution of outputs to downstream customers, is central to the overall success of any organisation. Any organisation that does not align its overall corporate strategy and its supply chain strategy will struggle to successfully deliver products and services to the market in a form that customers value. While it is not necessary for participants to be highly skilled in mathematics to undertake this course, you are expected to be familiar with, or be prepared to acquire, basic knowledge about the following concepts: basic probability and statistics, probability distributions and standard deviations (particularly the normal distribution), means and weighted averages, basic algebra. You will be expected to be able to perform some basic algebraic and statistical calculations in this course. This course offers a broad examination of the key issues involved in the management of supply chains. It places supply chain management in a strategic context and requires a blend of managerial and technological knowledge and skills. However, the course begins with a guided analysis of the strategic context of the organisation, so it can be taken early in your degree program, before any other strategy courses have been completed. This course is well suited to a broad range of students not only those involved in manufacturing industries as the concepts, processes and methods are readily adaptable to organisations that provide hard or soft product/service combination industries. One full Unit is devoted to service supply chains. There are numerous other references and opportunities to apply the theory to service supply chains in both the Unit notes and the associated textbook.",

Woven through the course is a critical examination of the interaction between the criminal justice system and the criminal law: specifically, that application of the law is shaped by and dependent on decisions made by criminal justice actors including police, prosecutors and judicial officers. Specific areas of focus include: why some activities are criminalised and others not; the use and misuse of discretion; the impact of the reliance on summary justice; the significance of pre-trial processes such as search, arrest and bail; and the over-representation of Indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.Crime and the Criminal Process also introduces the doctrinal building blocks of criminal law, and applies these principles to a number of key statutory offences such as public order offences and drugs offences which illustrate the process themes above. The impact of public policy and law reform is an important underlying theme.\u00a0\nMain Topics\nCriminalisation, over-criminalisation and defining crimeCriminal process, including police powers and pre-trial processComponents of criminal offences: physical and mental elementsDrugs (NSW only), including harm minimisation policies and incursions into general principles of criminal lawPublic order offenses",

This course is worth 6 units of credit. It complements, and is studied in the same session as, LAWS1124 - Lawyers and Society.\n\u00a0\nCFLS develops students\u2019 understanding of the functioning of the legal system and facility with foundational legal skills that students acquired in LAWS1121 \u2013 Legal System and Skills A. Students are introduced to fundamental concepts and legal paradigms in three core areas of substantive law: contract; tort and criminal law. The course focuses on students\u2019 acquisition of legal problem-solving skills in both oral and written contexts to enhance students\u2019 understanding of legal principles found in case and statute law in these three fields. It provides preparation for, and an introduction to, the study of Contract, Tort and Criminal Law in the LLB program.\n\u00a0\nModule 1: Contract\nA good grounding in the basic principles of contract law is a fundamental element of any legal education. This Module is an introduction to the study of voluntarily assumed legal obligations which govern many important areas of daily life. This Module focuses on students acquiring a sound understanding of a number of basic principles of contract law, through common law method, with particular focus on the elements required for the formation of a valid contract, namely offer and acceptance; consideration; intention to create legal relations; certainty and privity.\n\u00a0\nModule 2: Criminal Justice\nThe aims of the Criminal Justice module are to introduce students to foundational elements of the criminal law, and some key issues related to criminal justice. The course will include an examination of the components of criminal offences generally, and will take two substantive offences (murder and offensive language/behaviour) to see how these elements play out in practice.\n\u00a0\nModule 3: Tort\nThis module covers the part of the law of torts which signifies, broadly speaking, the law determining liability to pay compensation for wrongfully caused injury, damage or loss through medical negligence.\nThe prime objective is to introduce students to the core principles of negligence, including a critical understanding of the policy considerations informing the law. A second objective of this course is to examine a relatively limited number of leading cases and legislation in selected areas and thereby develop skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation. A third objective is to encourage students to consider the way in which the law of torts operates in the context of society as a whole, and the ways in which it is influenced by such particular factors as insurance, social security, and the need (or absence of a need) to ascribe fault. Thus there is a theoretical component to the course which introduces various debates about the nature and effectiveness of tort law.\u00a0 ",

The course exposes students to this material through an examination of Australia\u2019s hybrid constitutional inheritance from the United Kingdom and United States, as adapted in the creation and subsequent development of the federal Commonwealth. In doing so it also examines the implications of colonisation for Indigenous legal systems and assertions of Crown sovereignty. The role, powers and interrelationship of the three arms of government are considered in contemporary as well as historical context, as are the issues of rights protection and constitutional change.

In both cases, the course provides an introduction to materials that are expanded upon in later subjects. With respect to contract law, this course covers the formation of contracts and the doctrine of privity. Several other elements of contract law are dealt with later in the curriculum in Contracts. With respect to property law, this course considers the boundaries of the concept of property, as well as several of the rules with respect to the creation, transfer and protection of property rights. Again several other elements of property law are dealt with later in Land Law, and to some extent also in Equity and Trusts.\nThe course also introduces students to two smaller topics: agency and equitable estoppel.

The course explores ethical issues that arise in professional practice and the regulations and standards that govern them. It considers these issues and principles in light of our personal values, experiences and psychological biases, as well as wider and dynamic professional contexts. These contexts include the history and workings of the legal profession and its rapidly changing circumstances. They also include the diverse and demanding environments in which contemporary lawyers work. \nThis course treats questions of ethics as found in everyday decisions and behaviour, general as well as those particular to lawyers. However, Lawyers, Ethics &amp; Justice addresses, in particular, the responsibilities of lawyers in maintaining the integrity of the justice system. In doing so, students will analyse the roles lawyers do and should play in the justice system, and relate them to the values and routine skills lawyers have, or should have, to ensure effective and just outcomes. \nThe course is also designed for students to evaluate the conduct of lawyers, the nature of ethical practice, and the pursuit of justice in light of their own identities, values and skills. Students are asked to consider what acting in accordance their values would mean for their own professional lives. \nDuring the course, students will start to develop the skills they will need to engage in ethical legal practice, including those to: identify and address ethics issues; work with colleagues and other professionals to institute and maintain ethical work practices; recognise and manage the diverse needs and interests of clients; and integrate often competing duties to clients, the workplace, the profession, the judicial system and society.

        "description": "Legal Theory encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory.\n\nIn the Western tradition this reflection starts with Aristotle\u2019s concept of Nomos which defined law as the \u201cprinciples and customs which guide the whole way of life of a community, including specific commands and prohibitions\u2026but also including accounts of the nature of things and justifications of the law itself?\u201d We can translate this description in four key questions:\n\nWhat guides the life of the community (morality)?What can be commanded as necessary or prohibited (power)?What do we understand as the real nature of things (truth)?What justifies the restrictions, judgements and force of law (legality)?\n\nIn other words, law refers to metaphysical concepts and very concrete human behaviour and social practices in our day to day lives: stopping for a red light even if no car is coming; paying taxes even if we disagree with the government. Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently: why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?\n\nWithin the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.\n\nThe course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are: Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law: moral and political philosophy. \u00a0\n\nIn sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices. Its ultimate goal is to clarify what it means to be \u2018before the law\u2019 and if, how and where \u2018law meets justice\u2019.\n",

        "description": "This course seeks to understand the nature of law and justice and, in particular, the relationship between the two, in contemporary society. The point of departure will be a consideration of the character of justice. Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine what some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present-day have understood about the nature of justice. The focus will be not only on explaining and critically analyzing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law.\nNot only will the course analyse different theories of justice, but it will also put the ideas, gained through such analysis, to work by considering a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, what are the criteria of justice and how in modern circumstances might we ground these? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?\nMain Topics\nIntroduction the problem of Law and Justice via an examination of Plato\u2019s RepublicAristotle\u2019s theory of justice and its legacy (corrective and distributive justice; questions of justice requiring good judgment)From theories of law and justice conceived in terms of natural law to natural rights and social contract theory (Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke and Kant and Rawls)Non-contractualist theories of law and justice: Hume, the Utilitarians and particularly HegelLegal justice and justice as interpretation; Dworkin, and GadamerMarx\u2019s critique of all prevailing conceptions of legal rights, the rule of law and justiceJustice in a pluralist society; the just (secular) state; the just multicultural state and Global justiceThe contemporary Frankfurt School\u2019s theories of law and justice in terms of theories of discourse and recognition.Feminism, the ethic or care and the critique of legal justiceThe post-structuralist deconstruction of law and justice",

These topics are examined in their legal, ethical and socio-psychological dimensions. The course approaches these topics by first exploring the legal and factual elements that define evidence law. In the criminal context, the course additionally explores prosecutors\u2019 ethical and legal obligations to the court and to the defendant. From this preliminary framework students examine key principles, rules and institutional elements associated with the formal adjudication of legal disputes.

The course aims to foster in students critical analytical skills and values consistent with aspirational ideals of professional and ethical legal practice. These goals are pursued by observational fieldwork, audiovisual aids, occasional guest speakers, readings and the engagement of students in classroom discussion that is aimed at developing their understanding of the complexities and challenges evidence law and court processes create for litigants, lawyers, witnesses and decisionmakers.

Enrolment is by school consent, email:\u00a0law&#64;unsw.edu.au.\n\nIn their practical day-to-day activities, lawyers and citizens take, and must take, much for granted, both about society in which they work and live and about its legal order. Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society.\u00a0 Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them. Theoretical investigation looks beneath what we all too often take for granted, to see what accounts for it, how it works, and how it changes.\u00a0\n\nSocial theory is a particular way of asking theoretical questions, which tries to explain why things are as they are by examining the social practices and institutions that shape the way that people live.\u00a0 To study law and social theory is to explore theoretical issues that arise when we see law as one part of this broader social context.\u00a0\n\nSome of the questions that we address in the course include: what social functions are played by legal systems, and the modern legal system in particular? How does law intersect with other social systems, practices, and forms of power?\u00a0 How, for example, is the legal system influenced by the economy, and how does it shape the economy in turn?\u00a0 What is the relationship between the legal system and political actors, such as the state, bureaucracy, classes and social movements?\u00a0 How does law shape, and how is it influenced by, socially dominant ways of thinking, such as ideology, rationality, or beliefs about class, gender, and race?\u00a0 What drives change in the legal system?\u00a0 Is it, for example, the practices of lawyers, politicians, or social movements?\u00a0 Is it the evolution of ideas? Or economic imperatives?\u00a0\n\nWe will explore these questions in both an historical and contemporary context.\u00a0 We will examine the work of the foundational thinkers in the tradition of social theory, such as Karl Marx and Max Weber, who were responding to the massive social, economic, scientific and intellectual changes of the nineteenth century.\u00a0 Their work continues to provide insight into the relationship between law and society, because the contemporary world, has inherited many of the ideas and institutions that came to dominate society in their time, including the market economy, democracy, and liberal individualism.\u00a0 The course also engages with more contemporary theorists whose work responds to the changing social and legal landscape of the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0 This may include the work of Michel Foucault, systems theory, feminist criticism, or theories of biopolitics.\u00a0 We will draw on these thinkers, not only to reflect on the themes of the course, but to think about pressing issues, such as the impact of neoliberalism and globalisation on the law, the treatment of refugees, emergency politics and constitutional democracy, and the legal and political response to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStudying theories of law and society will hopefully lead us beyond our original, and usually quite unreflective views of what is important in law, what role it plays in society, whose interests it serves, what causes legal change, and how important law is. In probing these questions, we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\n",

It introduces students to the law of copyright (including moral rights), registered designs, trade marks, passing off, consumer law prohibiting misleading and deceptive conduct, breach of confidence, and patents. Students study the fundamental statutory provisions and common law principles that define the subject matter protected by these intellectual property doctrines, as well as the pre-conditions for protection and the nature of infringement. They learn how to approach intellectual property problems in practice, and gain insight into the interrelationships between intellectual property\u2019s various doctrines.\nThe course provides students with a good working knowledge of the fundamental principles of intellectual property law. It aims to build solid foundations for lawyers who may or may not want to specialise in intellectual property, as well as those who might later undertake further studies to specialise in this area of law.\nThis course is a pre-requisite for LAWS3057/JURD7357 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice, which is recommended for students who seek to further their knowledge of intellectual property policy issues and/or to deepen their skills applying intellectual property law in practice.\nMain Topics\nIntroduction to Intellectual PropertyCopyright, including Moral RightsConfidential informations.18 Australian Consumer Law,\u00a0(Competition and Consumer Act 2010, formerly s.52 Trade Practices Act 1974)Passing offTrade marksDesignsPatents",

        "description": "This course provides an introduction to the rapidly growing field of cyber security and to the role played by law and legal professionals in regulating it. This multi-disciplinary course is an opportunity for law students to develop an understanding of the role played by law in cyber policy and operation, and then to work alongside future security engineers solving cyber security challenges. Law students will focus on the role of regulation, while engineering students (COMP6441/COMP6841 Security Engineering and Cyber Security) will cover more technical computing material, with all students coming together in tutorials to analyse policy and practical challenges. Law students are the \u2018legal experts\u2019 in interdisciplinary spaces, engaging with engineering students in collective problem-solving. Over the course of the Term, students will gain confidence in working collaboratively with engineers.\nThe course is not a typical law course in its structure or assessment. Law students attend a two hour lecture on the foundations of cyber security (with Engineering students), a two hour law seminar, and a two hour tutorial (with Engineering students) each week. While there are few readings (mostly statutes and policy documents, some cases), there are online law and engineering activities to complete each week. These sometimes take law students outside their comfort zone, encouraging &#34;security thinking&#34; and an &#34;attacker mindset.&#34; Students should expect to commit approximately 15 hours a week to the course including attendance, self-directed research, completion of on-line modules, preparation for tutorials and seminars, and completion of assessment.\nFoundational security topics to which law students are introduced include insiders, privacy, cybercrime, social engineering, risk, secrets, authentication, physical security, weakest link, supply chain, cognitive biases, organisational change, incident response, security analysis, open source intelligence and reconnaissance. These are introduced through case studies, focusing on recent developments. Legal topics include relevant aspects of tort law, contract law, consumer law, directors duties, privacy law, telecommunications regulation, critical infrastructure regulation, criminal law, national security and law enforcement powers, and international law. The focus is on Australian law, but comparative material is included where relevant. Other regulation (such as national policy and standards) are also discussed. The goal is understanding how the different strands of law apply to current policy problems in the field of cyber security, rather than being a comprehensive coverage of particular doctrinal domains covered elsewhere in the degree. Tutorials provide an interactive opportunity to tackle complex policy problems from a multi-disciplinary perspective.\nThe primary background needed is a keen, devious and analytical mind. Technical computing skills are not needed. However for those wishing to acquire or appreciate the technical aspects of cyber security \u2013 all engineering lectures, classes, and learning activities are open and available for law students to attend. This is entirely optional and non-examinable. It is for those who are curious. To get the most from this course, students will need to engage in independent study and research and be able to act as independent self-directed learners.",

It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.\n\nIntellectual Property 1: Copyright and Designs considers two key aspects of Australian IP law. The first, which is the focus of the course, is the law of copyright. Copyright primarily protects creative and entrepreneurial subject matter such as books, art, music, films and TV broadcasts. The course focuses on key issues such as the history of and justifications for copyright; copyright subject matter; requirements for subsistence; ownership and exploitation; infringement, defences and remedies; and moral rights. Attention will also be paid to emerging debates, policy issues and law reform proposals on such issues as the impact of digital technology, rights in entertainment franchises and indigenous artists\u2019 rights. The second aspect of IP law considered in the course is registered designs, with a focus on requirements for registration, infringement, and the techniques used to manage the overlap between copyright and design protection.\n\nIntellectual\u00a0 Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.\n\nPlease be aware that students who take Intellectual Property 1 and/or Intellectual Property 2 will not be able to take LAWS3021 Foundations of Intellectual Property Law and/or LAWS3057 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice.

        "description": "This course considers contemporary legal issues in international criminal law and transitional justice. It places international criminal law in the broader context of state sovereignty, international peace and security, post-conflict reconciliation and the rule of law. It examines the role of international criminal law and transitional justice within public international law generally, and its relationship with other areas of law, such as state responsibility, human rights, international humanitarian law, national criminal law and international refugee law. It will examine the distinction between state and individual responsibility, consider the development of international criminal law and its institutions, outline the main principles and rules of international criminal law, both substantive and procedural, as well as discussing alternatives to criminal responsibility such as truth and reconciliation commissions and amnesties. In particular, the course will examine the substantive legal framework to ensure accountability for acts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international law. It will also assess the history, structure, jurisdiction and jurisprudence of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the International Criminal Court, as well as the Special Court for Sierra Leone and other hybrid and internationalized tribunals. The role of national legal systems in ensuring accountability for international crimes is also outlined.\nMain Topics\nIntroduction to international criminal law and its sources.International criminal law as distinct from transnational and national criminal law.The distinction between individual and state responsibility.History of international criminal law and its enforcement.Substantive international criminal law: genocide; crimes against humanity; war crimes; aggression; other crimes under international law.Enforcement of international criminal law: national courts; the ICTY and ICTR; the International Criminal Court; other hybrid or internationalized criminal tribunals.Enforcement: the International Criminal Court: jurisdiction; trigger mechanisms; state cooperation; the relationship with the Security Council; complementarity.Defences, immunity and command responsibility.Procedural concerns: rights of the accused; fair trial guarantees; victim representation.Alternatives to criminal prosecution: duty to prosecute; truth and reconciliation commissions; amnesties; lustration; reparations.",

        "description": "Investment treaties are among the most powerful and controversial instruments of international economic governance. They grant foreign investors broad protections from interference by the governments of the countries in which they invest. They also establish an international mechanism for adjudication and enforcement, allowing foreign investors to bypass national courts and, instead, bring cases against states directly to international arbitration. The amount at stake in these disputes regularly runs into billions of dollars. Philip Morris\u2019 recent case against Australia arising from Australia\u2019s tobacco plain packaging legislation is a high profile example. Supporters argue that investment treaties promote foreign investment and respect for the rule of law in countries that are bound by them. Critics argue that investment treaties constitute a \u2018bill of rights for multinational corporations\u2019 that is enforced through \u2018secret courts\u2019.\nThis course provides an introduction to the law and policy of the investment treaty regime. The course covers the network of almost 3000 bilateral investment treaties, along with the investment chapters of multi-issue free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. It also covers international dispute settlement through investment treaty arbitration under the ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules.\nMain topics\nThe range of foreign investors and foreign investments covered by investment treaties;Key substantive protections contained in investment treaties, such as guarantees of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019, non-discriminatory treatment and compensation for expropriation;Rules and procedures governing investment treaty arbitration;International enforcement of arbitral awards.\nAll topics are illustrated with practical examples drawn from the 700 known investment treaty arbitrations conducted to date.\n\u00a0\nThe course also encourages students to engage with the central policy debates relating to the investment treaty regime, including:\nwhether governments fully understood the implications of investment treaties when they signed them;whether investment treaties deliver economic benefits promised by their proponents;how the goal of protecting foreign investment should be balanced with governments\u2019 need to regulate in the public interest;how investment treaties relate to other regimes of investment governance, such as investor-state contracts, national law and investment insurance.\n\u00a0\nThe course is relevant to:\nstudents considering a career in international dispute settlement, whether in private practice or as a government lawyer;students seeking to understand the interaction between national and international legal regimes governing international economic activity;students interested in wider debates about globalisation and the regulation of the international economy.",

        "description": "Restitution of unjust enrichment remains a contentious area of the common law with a vibrant academic and judicial discourse. This is because, in comparison with civilian legal systems, Australia (1987) and England and Wales (1991) were both slow to recognise unjust enrichment as a source of rights and duties within the law of obligations. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s many unjust enrichment claims have been decided in Australia and England, resulting in significant divergences between the two jurisdictions. These divergences remain contentious and a source of debate between appellate courts and legal scholars.\n\nAt a high level of generality, a plaintiff in an unjust enrichment case must show that: (i) the defendant was enriched; (ii) the defendant\u2019s enrichment was gained at the plaintiff\u2019s expense; and (iii) the defendant\u2019s enrichment was unjust. The court will then, in turn, (iv) consider whether the defendant has any good defences to the claim. This course is arranged in line with this analytical structure and also considers the convergences and divergences between Australian and English law at each stage of analysis.\n\nThe main topics of study are set out below:\n\nIntroduction to unjust enrichment and the remedy of restitutionIntroduction to the elements of an unjust enrichment claimEnrichment I (valuing enrichment)Enrichment II (at the plaintiff\u2019s expense)Unjust Factors I (mistaken conferral of a benefit)Unjust Factors II (failure of basis/consideration)Unjust Factors III (coercion/duress)Unjust Factors IV (necessity)Defences (change of position/estoppel/ contract/ passing on)\n",

It is quite likely that lawyers outside the United States will come into contact with American law, American lawyers or American clients, and would thus be better served for having an understanding of the essential characteristics and aspects of the American legal system. In addition, given the influence and role of the United States in the world, American legal concepts, ideas and approaches are often borrowed or considered by non-American courts and legislatures as they develop their own law. Successful transplantation is difficult, but made easier through a knowledge of the borrowed legal system and a corresponding ability to then critically evaluate the value and utility of any proposed transplantation.\u00a0\nThe course will focus principally on the study of the federal and state legal systems within the United States of America. The course will include consideration of the primary features of the American legal system, including: U.S. legal history; U.S. judicial structure and operation; the U.S. Constitution; and the legislative and administrative structure and process.

We will consider the advantages and disadvantages of high density urban living vs low density suburban life. We will examine the role of private property law, particularly strata and community title, in constructing the built environment and then managing the people and communities who live there. \u00a0For example, should private property law be used not only to mandate what people build on their own land, but how they behave or even dress? Can &#34;community&#34; be created in new housing developments or must it develop organically? Should large tracts of bushland or waterfronts, roads, parks or sewerage treatment facilities be privatised or should they remain public assets? We will look at groups of people who have opted out of the city, setting up alternative communes or &#34;utopias&#34; in rural areas with community title legislation. \u00a0What is the motivation for these communities and do they work?

It provides an introduction into the legal system of the People&#39;s Republic of China with particular reference to modern developments in commercial law and other important legal areas. China opened up its economy to market forces only in the late 1970s. When it did so, law and the legal system lost the pariah status they had been given during the Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

It covers topics of concern to individuals as well as business and government, including protection of privacy and intellectual property in a digital environment, electronic contracts, computer and information security, cybercrime, and the implications of advances in analytics, machine learning and autonomous systems.\nThe interaction between traditional law and information technology plays a central role in the course. To analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale, while exploring its application to both novel and familiar scenarios arising from the ubiquity of digital technologies. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how the principles of personal information privacy can be adapted to a virtualised global setting; how emerging technologies can disrupt existing legal forms such as contracts or \u2018anonymous\u2019 data; and determining the appropriate models of liability and responsibility applicable to platforms based on eg, social media or AI.\nA statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: \u201c[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world\u2019s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.\u201d Lawyers who fail to understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, fail to identify emerging conflicts of interests, face unsatisfactory enforcement prospects, and may overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.\nTopics\nIntroduction to Internet, software, digital data and related technologiesTranslationContracts, \u2018disruption\u2019 and protection of parties in a digital environmentData and cyber security in virtualised industriesCybercrime: law, enabling technologies and remediesData surveillance and regulation of global data practicesExamples of regulatory challenges of novel technologies, including AIData sovereignty and extraterritoriality",

        "description": "This unit explores the emerging complexity of the relation between Law and Biology in the 21th century. It examines the following question: What does the concept &#34;biology&#34;\u00a0do\u00a0in legal descriptions of events in the world. Law not just regulates, allows, or limits what can be done or undone biologically but it also defines or alters our philosophical, political or social self-understanding. Both law and biology are meaningful structures which define, diagnose, and create concepts of persons as &#34;nature&#34;, &#34;bodies&#34;, &#34;organism&#34;, &#34;groups&#34; or &#34;life&#34; (to name just a few). &#34;Law and Biology&#34; aims to provide a historical, analytical, and critical reflection on the legal implications of biological or biologized legalities.\nThe unit complements other units offered at the law school such as Legal Theory, Law and Social Theory, and Theories of Law and Justice. Similar to these units, Law and Biology has an emphasis on theoretical and critical aspects of the topic and relates law to an interdisciplinary field of knowledge and legal practices. The unit also relates to units such as Law and Medical Health or Intellectual Property Law which connect law with the biomedical or biotechnological field. The main difference with the theory electives is that Law and Biology takes place in an entirely different context, the field of biology, and that its focus is on theorizing law in the contemporary world where biolegitimacy increasingly takes hold. The difference with the other units is that the Law and Biology unit does not focus on matters of litigation. Instead, it opens up a broader and theoretical horizon both in the ways law itself can be understood and how it is connected to biology and science as a method. This connection will be explained through historical, analytical and legal insights and will include reflections on the scientific and ethical questions this relation provokes in the contemporary legal system.\u00a0\nStudents wishing to think about law \u201coutside the box&#34; and who are interested in developing a rich theoretical and interdisciplinary perspective on law combining insights from philosophy, biology, technology, sociology, neurology, psychology and ethics will surely enjoy this course. It is recommended that students have some knowledge in legal theory through having taken one of the legal theory prescribed electives before enrolling in this course. No pre-existing knowledge of biology is necessary.\nMainTopics\n1. Law and Nature\u00a0\n2. The Body of Law\u00a0\u00a0\n3. Biopolitics\n4. Biotechnology\n5. Neurolaw\n6.

This will pave the way toward studying the benefit/disadvantages of the tools available to the regulators. The second part of the course will then explores the advantages/disadvantages of private and public actions in the context of corporate breaches.\nThe course allows the students to evaluate the different outcomes that result from public and private actions. During the course, students will start to develop a better understanding of the different options available to regulators and private parties to deal with corporate breaches of the law and the impact that one action may have on the other.\nThis course combines interactive teaching, group work and exploration of relevant topics and theoretical frameworks that are of key interest to students.\nThe course is particularly suitable for students interested in careers in corporate and commercial litigation, criminal law and enforcement or corporate in-house roles.\nThe course is not currently available to JD students, however there are JURD courses that cover similar material, in particular JURD7364 Regulation, Litigation and Enforcement, JURD7588 Regulation of Online Investing and JURD7992 Securities and Financial Markets Regulation.\u00a0 \n",

It is a unique body of law comprising two separate and distinct bodies of rules: the jus ad bellum, which is the law governing the legality of the resort to force, and the jus in bello, which is the law regulating the conduct of hostilities. The jus in bello is also referred to as humanitarian law, the law of armed conflict, or the laws of war. The law of armed conflict is a body of rules that was developed to protect the most vulnerable groups during armed conflict and to mitigate the deleterious effects of the methods of warfare.\nThe course is designed to provide an overview of the fundamental principles of the law of armed conflict (or international humanitarian law). It will place international humanitarian law within public international law more generally, and delineate its relationship to other areas of international law (such as the international law of human rights). Specifically, the course will cover the principles and rules relating to the protection of individuals during armed conflict, as well as rules relating to the means and methods of warfare, including weapons issues. We will also explore issues relating to the implementation and international and national enforcement of international humanitarian law.\nMain Topics\nthe position of international humanitarian law within public\u00a0international lawthe relationship between rules related to the right to use force\u00a0and international humanitarian lawthe historical development of international humanitarian law normsthe principles determining the rules applicable in different\u00a0conflict situations, or issues of classification of conflictsrules related to the protection of persons during armed conflict,\u00a0as well as situations of violence not amounting to armed conflictrules and principles regarding the means and methods of warfare,\u00a0including weapons issuesthe relationship between international humanitarian law and\u00a0international human rights lawimplementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law,\u00a0\u00a0including a brief overview of the international tribunals for the former\u00a0\u00a0Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and the International Criminal Court, as well as\u00a0\u00a0national enforcement of international humanitarian lawchallenges and potential new directions for international\u00a0humanitarian law, including issues raised by terrorism,the role of the ICRC and the Red Cross Movement in armed conflict, and the work of governments, other international organisations and NGOs.",

The course also considers the capacity of the current international legal framework to respond to statelessness and other displaced persons who do not fall within the framework of the Refugee Convention, such as internally displaced persons, persons fleeing human rights abuses or civil war, and those whose movement is a result of climate change or environmental catastrophe. The course considers the theoretical underpinnings of the international forced migration regime and queries why States have agreed to protect certain categories of persons and not others, and whether this is legally and/or ethically sound.\nThis course considers the legal obligations of States and international organisations to assist and protect forced migrants. While the focus of the course is on international law responses to issues of forced migration, consideration will also be given to the relationship between the international legal regime and domestic law.

Students will learn how to use this software to generate\u00a0legal documents, automate intake processes, and assist users to navigate solutions to legal problems. After learning the necessary skills, students will work in small groups, in partnership with a not-for-profit centre or organisation, to design and build an application.\n\nIn class, students will also be exposed to a variety of examples of automation of legal tasks, and the various legal and practical issues associated with their use, including issues of professional regulation. This will include guest lectures on a variety of topics, both technical and procedural. Students will also become familiar with theoretical approaches to legal information systems development, and the range of technologies and approaches that may contribute to applications development.\n\nDesigning legal information systems requires students to think through a class of legal problems in a structured way. Systems can be used to generate legal documents from precedents, with variations based on the responses of a user, aswell as to answer legal questions within a particular field. They are one component of the increasing tendency to automate legal tasks. Used well, legal information systems can facilitate access to legal information and expertise, but always within the limits of their designer&#39;s foresight. Designing a good legal information system thus requires skills in legal analysis and problem-solving, as well as the ability to think creatively and explore different approaches to a problem.\n\nThis course does not require students to have any pre-existing skills or experience in expert systems or computer programming - the course itself includes instruction on how to use expert system software.\n\nThis course is sponsored by Gilbert and Tobin.\n",

        "description": "After two centuries of increasingly intensive urbanisation, people are more disconnected from food production than they have ever been before. A minority of the world\u2019s population grow food, and in highly urbanised countries that minority is vanishingly small. Less than 0.01% of Australians are employed in agriculture of any kind. Modern agriculture is industrialised and food production corporatized. However, across the globe, there is a growing movement to reconnect with food production and to critically examine how food reaches our tables. Researchers and food activists are highlighting the social, cultural, ethical and environmental costs of modern food production, and exploring alternatives to industrial food systems.\nThis course will introduce students to a broad range of legal and policy issues, at both domestic and international level, that relate to food. Drawing on the expertise of multiple teachers, topics may include:\nRegulatory models that affect food production and distribution, including international covenants on food security and food aid, environmental laws, patents, trademarks, cultural heritage laws, biotechnology and health standards, animal rights, consumer laws and local government/planning law;\nBiotechnology and food production, including the demise of historical prohibitions on agricultural patents and public interest litigation around patenting life forms; the distinction between discovery and invention and its consequence; the distinction between open-pollenated seeds, hybrids and GMOs; contemporary developments in agribusiness and biotech patenting; plant variety rights; seed saving and farmers\u2019 rights;\nThe environment and food, including the environmental impact of nutrient and pesticide pollution, biodiversity loss and deforestation, water overuse, carbon emissions and waste; legal and regulatory regimes designed to respond to these challenges, illustrated through case studies such as the pollution of the Great Barrier Reef by agriculture run-off; the regulation of water use in agriculture (70% of the world\u2019s water) and in the food chain (two thirds of our total water footprint), including legal rights to surface and groundwater, water planning, allocations, efficiency approaches, markets, pricing and enforcement;\nAboriginal science and rights to food, including an Indigenous knowledges perspective on science, agriculture and property rights to water, land, plants and animals, and data sovereignty; the regulation and use of this knowledge, including global initiatives around biopiracy; access and benefit sharing agreements; creative commons licensing; traditional knowledge databases; regional WIPO initiatives;\nDiverse legal models of enterprise in the food sector, particularly those that link production and distribution in innovative ways; the intersection between the sharing economy and the food system; the potential for innovative domestic models to help realise food-related international Sustainable Development goals;\nUrban agriculture, including the challenges of reconnecting overwhelmingly urban populations with food growing and production; legal rights to access land through public and private law; grassroots activism, community groups, allotments and guerrilla gardening, in Australia and overseas.\nInteractive classes on a range of issues will give students a broad understanding of laws and policies that relate to food. \u00a0Classes may vary from term to term, depending on staff availability. A research essay on a self-selected topic will allow students to develop food research skills, as well as an in-depth understanding of a single area.",

It is vital to the marketing, advertising, entertainment, communications and science and technology industries. The two courses together aim to introduce students to each of the general law and statutory IP protections outlined above. For each of the heads of protection, the courses gives detailed consideration to the subject matter which is protected, the pre-conditions for protection, and the nature of infringement. Various justifications for IP are also considered, particularly in the context of new or developing forms of IP.\n\nThis course, Intellectual Property 2: Trade Marks and Patents, focuses on three aspects of Australian IP law. The first is the legal protection of business reputation, which includes the law of registered trade marks and related doctrines such as the tort of passing off. The requirements for registering marks, infringement and defences, and the elements of passing off will be canvassed, as will policy debates over the scope of legal protection. The second is the law of patents, which protects new innovations. It will cover the acquisition, ownership, exploitation and enforcement of patent rights and look at emerging issues such as the protection of biotechnology. The third is the action for breach of confidence, which protects trade secrets and personal information.\n\nIntellectual Property 1 and Intellectual Property 2 can be taken in any order.\n\nPlease be aware that students who take Intellectual Property 1 and/or Intellectual Property 2 will not be able to take LAWS3021 Foundations of Intellectual Property Law and/or LAWS3057 Advanced Intellectual Property Policy and Practice.

This course teaches students how the Act and Regulations operate together to regulate entry and stay in Australia and then focuses upon some regulatory issues in detail.\nThe workings of the visa system and the different categories of entrants are outlined and general matters relevant to all visa classes (Schedules 3, 4 and 5 of the Migration Regulations) are considered, including health and character criteria. The visa process, family migration and refugee visas are a topic of interest. \nThe relationship between immigration and Australian citizenship is considered. \nThe relationship between immigration law and Government policy is considered, both in terms of policy considerations underpinning legislative developments and policy considerations operating throughout the administration of the law. The course seeks to critically evaluate immigration law from varied standpoints, including whether it is efficient in achieving policy goals, the extent to which it complies with human rights norms and the rule of law.\nMain Topics\nImmigration law/policy: its subject matter and evaluationMigration Act and RegulationsCitizenshipVisa cancellationsFamily MigrationCharacter.",

        "description": "Most legal education in common law systems scrutinises the interpretation and development of the law via decisions made by courts in the process of litigation. This fosters the assumption that litigation, or legal advice predicting the outcome of litigation, is the normal method of resolving disputes. In fact, only a small proportion of disputes are resolved by litigation and there is a growing dissatisfaction with the cost, speed and adversarial character of litigation, and a corresponding interest in alternative forms of non-adjudicative dispute resolution.\nThis course follows on from Resolving Civil Disputes, investigating and giving practical experience in a range of alternative forms of dispute resolution including negotiation, facilitation, mediation and group process. It requires students to identify and analyse examples of the interface between the outcomes of non-adjudicative dispute resolution processes and what might be termed &#39;black-letter law&#39; such as contract and revenue law.\nDispute Resolution is delivered as a skills course. Whilst there will be some formal tuition, the focus of the course is on experiential learning. Skill training depends on a building block approach to learning whereby basic ideas are built upon through group discussion, preparation, performance and review.\nBecause group dynamics and interaction play such an important part in the process, skills training works most effectively when it occurs in concentrated bursts of a day or more. For this reason, the course is delivered in full day sessions with an introductory lecture at the beginning.\nMain Topics\nThe taxonomy of ADR and introduction to the most commonly encountered processesThe influence of group dynamics on ADR processesTools from the Harvard Negotiation ProgramDevelopment of some &#39;rules of thumb&#39; which enhance the application of ADR principles in a group settingOther influences on the ADR process such as behavioural preferences and communication stylesCommunication in dispute resolution and developing a communication strategyVarious mediation role plays and debrief of case studies",

Students will be assisting Solicitors in advising clients in making complaints against the police, as well as conducting work on research, policy and community legal education under the supervision of the Police Powers Clinic convenor. Through client work, advocacy and law reform projects and a weekly two hour seminar, the program aims to strengthen students&#39; practical skills in research, writing, advocacy, problem-solving, team work and independent judgment. Students will spend 1 day (7 hours-9am to 5pm) at Redfern Legal Centre each week for 10 weeks. There will be a half-day induction program at the Centre which is compulsory for all students.\n",

Australia is a common law country \u2013 its legal system is based on the English common law system. This course offers students a comprehensive introduction to the Australian legal system and contrast with the civil law system.\nThe course will examine the historical origins of the Australian legal system, some of the principles underpinning our legal system, including the importance of the concept of the rule of law. It also covers the operation of the principal institutions of the legal system, the legislative and executive arms of government and the judiciary and courts. This will include the jurisdiction of Australian courts, the process by which cases are decided and the doctrine of precedent, consideration of alternative\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Methods of dispute resolution and an examination of the role of the legal profession. There will also be an overview of the main branches of law.\nAboriginal customary law will be looked at and there will be a critical analysis of the circumstances of the adoption of the common law in Australia and the effect on the indigenous people. There will also be examination of the recognition of customary law and native title.\nNo prior knowledge of the Australian legal system is required.

        "description": "This course seeks to understand the nature of law and justice and, in particular, the relationship between the two in contemporary society. It begins by exploring the question \u201cwhat is justice\u201d? Since this is an enduring philosophical question, posed differently at different times, it will be approached historically. We examine some of the key thinkers in the philosophical and jurisprudential tradition from the Greeks to the present and how they have understood justice. The focus here will be not only on explaining and critically analysing different general theories of justice, but especially upon determining how these theories articulate the specific relation (or lack of relation) between justice and law. The course will then put these ideas to work through a consideration of a number of contemporary problems concerning law and justice. For example, how in modern circumstances might we ground the criteria of justice? Is it helpful to understand modern law on the model of either distributive or corrective justice? Is any interpretation of law always based on an understanding of legal justice? And what are we to make of various claims to justice, for instance, international justice, intergenerational justice, historical or transitional justice?\nMain Topics\nIntroduction the problem of Law and Justice via an examination of Plato\u2019s RepublicAristotle\u2019s theory of justice and its legacy (corrective and distributive justice; questions of justice requiring good judgment)From theories of law and justice conceived in terms of natural law to natural rights and social contract theory (Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke and Kant and Rawls)Non-contractualist theories of law and justice: Hume, the Utilitarians and particularly HegelLegal justice and justice as interpretation; Dworkin, and GadamerMarx\u2019s critique of all prevailing conceptions of legal rights, the rule of law and justiceJustice in a pluralist society; the just (secular) state; the just multicultural state and Global justiceThe contemporary Frankfurt School\u2019s theories of law and justice in terms of theories of discourse and recognition.Feminism, the ethic or care and the critique of legal justiceThe post-structuralist deconstruction of law and justice",

        "description": "Legal Theory encourages students to take a reflective interest in the study of law - its intellectual foundations, its social conditions, its relationships with morality and politics, and its kinship with other disciplines, especially philosophy, ethics and social theory.\n\nIn the Western tradition this reflection starts with Aristotle\u2019s concept of Nomos which defined law as the \u201cprinciples and customs which guide the whole way of life of a community, including specific commands and prohibitions\u2026but also including accounts of the nature of things and justifications of the law itself?\u201d We can translate this description in four key questions:\n\nWhat guides the life of the community (morality)?What can be commanded as necessary or prohibited (power)?What do we understand as the real nature of things (truth)?What justifies the restrictions, judgements and force of law (legality)?\n\nIn other words, law refers to metaphysical concepts and very concrete human behaviour and social practices in our day to day lives: stopping for a red light even if no car is coming; paying taxes even if we disagree with the government. Why do we do these things? Is it because we want to do the \u201cright\u201d thing? Or simply because it is the law? Put differently: why do humans need and create laws and what do we aim to accomplish through law?\n\nWithin the Western tradition, law often reflects religious values (for example, those of the Ten Commandments) while Roman Law established the first sophisticated \u201crule of law\u201d. From the authoritarian commands of Kings, Queens or dictators to the promise of \u201csocial contracts\u201d and modern deliberative democracy, law has developed into a highly complex tool to organize the way we live together. It is now perceived as safe-guarding our freedom and equality, as solidifying the power of economic and political elites, empowering minorities to fight racism and discrimination, a tool to control property and territory, and organize global flows of people and products. Law is, most importantly, also our main instrument to overcome violence and injustice, punish, settle conflicts and create reconciliation.\n\nThe course examines all these aspects in a historical, analytical and critical manner by showcasing different legal-philosophical positions, mainly taken from the Western jurisprudential canon while also looking at Indigenous and Asian perspectives. Some of the theories we engage with are: Natural Law, Legal Positivism, Legal Hermeneutics, Legal Realism, Feminist Jurisprudence, Legal Pluralism, Legal Pragmatism. In addition, the course engages with the wider framework of law: moral and political philosophy. \u00a0\n\nIn sum, Legal Theory reflects on fundamental problems of modern law from a legal, moral and political perspective and provides students with a deeper understanding of the presuppositions that inform law, legal institutions and their own future professional practices. Its ultimate goal is to clarify what it means to be \u2018before the law\u2019 and if, how and where \u2018law meets justice\u2019.\n",

Lawyers practice within established legal systems, with more or less settled institutions, techniques, traditions and rules. Citizens live, and the laws operate, in societies in which specific social arrangements, structures, roles, expectations and conceptions of what is possible and what is right, are widely held and shape our views about law and about society.\u00a0 Customarily, most of us think within these categories and arrangements, rather than about them. Theoretical investigation looks beneath what we all too often take for granted, to see what accounts for it, how it works, and how it changes.\u00a0\n\nSocial theory is a particular way of asking theoretical questions, which tries to explain why things are as they are by examining the social practices and institutions that shape the way that people live.\u00a0 To study law and social theory is to explore theoretical issues that arise when we see law as one part of this broader social context.\u00a0\n\nSome of the questions that we address in the course include: what social functions are played by legal systems, and the modern legal system in particular? How does law intersect with other social systems, practices, and forms of power?\u00a0 How, for example, is the legal system influenced by the economy, and how does it shape the economy in turn?\u00a0 What is the relationship between the legal system and political actors, such as the state, bureaucracy, classes and social movements?\u00a0 How does law shape, and how is it influenced by, socially dominant ways of thinking, such as ideology, rationality, or beliefs about class, gender, and race?\u00a0 What drives change in the legal system?\u00a0 Is it, for example, the practices of lawyers, politicians, or social movements?\u00a0 Is it the evolution of ideas? Or economic imperatives?\u00a0\n\nWe will explore these questions in both an historical and contemporary context.\u00a0 We will examine the work of the foundational thinkers in the tradition of social theory, such as Karl Marx and Max Weber, who were responding to the massive social, economic, scientific and intellectual changes of the nineteenth century.\u00a0 Their work continues to provide insight into the relationship between law and society, because the contemporary world, has inherited many of the ideas and institutions that came to dominate society in their time, including the market economy, democracy, and liberal individualism.\u00a0 The course also engages with more contemporary theorists whose work responds to the changing social and legal landscape of the 20th and 21st centuries.\u00a0 This may include the work of Michel Foucault, systems theory, feminist criticism, or theories of biopolitics.\u00a0 We will draw on these thinkers, not only to reflect on the themes of the course, but to think about pressing issues, such as the impact of neoliberalism and globalisation on the law, the treatment of refugees, emergency politics and constitutional democracy, and the legal and political response to climate change.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStudying theories of law and society will hopefully lead us beyond our original, and usually quite unreflective views of what is important in law, what role it plays in society, whose interests it serves, what causes legal change, and how important law is. In probing these questions, we might come to confirm, modify or abandon our original assumptions; we will always, however, find these assumptions are more problematic, controversial and puzzling than they appeared at first to be.\n\n\u00a0\n",

This course will look at the body of feminist legal theory and identify its major insights into the ways in which law is gendered and how this contributes to the construction of inequality. Feminist analyses of law provide some of the most significant and challenging explanatory frameworks for understanding the practice and organisation of laws and legal institutions. These insights and frameworks focus on concepts such as the public/private divide, equality and intersectional discrimination, representation and power. The course will examine various areas of human experience such as work and the economy, the family and relationships, reproduction and bodies, representation and expression, and the way in which law shapes these. Feminist engagements within each area will be explored. The course will consider a range of approaches taken by feminist lawyers to critique, reform and transform law. Various strategies at the local and international level will be studied including the use of human rights to challenge gender inequality and disadvantage.",

While we anticipate the Latin American experience to be the backbone of the course, that experience will be discussed in contrast with experiences in Africa, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.\n\nTopics (non-exhaustive list of possible topics, pending availability of staff and guest speakers at the partner university):\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Introduction to the Field of Transitional Justice\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Redemocratization and Political Reform in the Context of Transition\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Investigate, Prosecute and Punish: Approaches to the Criminalization of Atrocities in the Aftermath of Transition\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Truth and Reconciliation as an Alternative to Criminal Prosecutions\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Amnesties in Transitional Justice: Between Forgiveness and Oblivion\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 The Transplantation of Transitional Justice Models across Jurisdictions\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 The Lasting Impact of the Eastern European and African Experiences on Latin American Approaches to Transition\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Strategic Litigation and Transitional Justice\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Social Movements in the Transitional Process: the Roles of NGOs and Faith-Based Organizations\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 The Impact of Transition on Public Policy: Environmental Law\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 The Economics of Transitional Justice\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 The Right to Truth as Part of Transitional Justice\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 Cultural Heritage Law, Memorialization and Transition\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 The Internationalization of Transitional Justice: the Impact of Regional Human Rights Courts\u2019 Jurisprudence\n\no\u00a0\u00a0 The Limits of Transitional Justice: Critical Stock-Taking\n\nPreference will be given to students who have not undertaken an overseas course within the UNSW LLB.\n",

        "description": "Trade remedies are the most popular area in international trade law practice and the most adjudicated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). They are actions taken by governments to counteract \u201cdumping\u201d through antidumping measures, subsidies through countervailing measures, and unexpected increases in the volume of imports through safeguard measures, for the protection of domestic industries. A typical form of these measures is an imposition of additional import duties on the top of the standard ones. WTO members are free to resort to trade remedies but must follow the relevant WTO rules.\nThis course offers a comprehensive and detailed study of the laws and practice of trade remedies. It studies the rationale for trade remedies; the domestic law and practice in selected countries with a focus on Australia (as an active user of trade remedies) and China (as a major target of trade remedies worldwide); the relevant WTO rules and major dispute settlement cases; negotiations of reforms of WTO rules on trade remedies; and the regulation of trade remedies under free trade agreements (FTAs). The course offers abundant opportunities for students to gain legal expertise and practical experience through case studies, simulation, and face-to-face discussion with leading trade and commercial lawyers. As the laws and practice of trade remedies in different jurisdictions share common features and create common issues, this course will provide the knowledge and practical skills necessary for further studies and trade law practice in all major jurisdictions (e.g. Australia, China, the US, the EU, Canada, and India).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0",

It is suggested that the best practitioners in this area are those with sufficient intellectual understanding and curiosity to connect different doctrinal areas of law in a way which serves their clients&#39; interests most comprehensively. This includes recognising factors which shape the laws regarding inheritance and recognising where changes in those factors are likely to alter the needs of clients in matters like estate planning.\nMain Topics\nIntroduction - history and nature of SuccessionComparative Succession LawIntestate Succession ( succession where there is no will)Death and the body in succession lawTestate Succession or the Law of WillsFamily ProvisionGrants of Representation and some Powers and Duties Legal Personal RepresentativesAdministration of Assets ",

It also draws on political theory and political science to help assess proposals for law reform, such as introducing quotas for female parliamentarians, or penalising political candidates who fail to be truthful in their campaign advertisements.

The second part of the course examines criticisms of the link between constitutionalism and popular sovereignty that emerged in response to the revolutionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. These will include Marxist and anarchist claim that the state cannot realise popular self-determination and so needs to be eliminated through revolution, and the reactionary argument that democracy undermines law, order and morality. The final section of the course explores the radical democratic turn of critical theory since the 1970s and its tendency to critique law and rights while appropriating them for emancipatory politics. The course will situate these theories in their historical context and examine their contemporary relevance in the activities of existing social movements. Students will emerge from the course with a knowledge of theories of law and democracy that have shaped political history.\u00a0 They will also develop a critical understanding of the strengths and limitations of law and revolutionary politics as vehicles for realising democratic aspirations.

It builds on and extends students&#39; studies in criminal law, criminal procedure, the law of evidence, legal profession and various clinical and experiental law courses, including Kingsford Legal Centre. It does this by providing a multidisciplinary framework that explicates the role of participants in the criminal trial process. Classroom discussion focuses on commentaries examining a variety of issues associated with the dynamics of criminal trials. These issues vary from year to year, allowing for topical themes to be developed but they include comparative analysis, human rights principles and various multidisciplinary\u00a0 perspectives including, the observations of historians, psychologists, sociologists, architects and linguists. A practice-orientation is an important component of the course as it assists to develop the rhetoric/reality theme that guides the course. It is fulfilled through guest speakers such as barristers and trial judges and through students fieldwork obligations.\u00a0 Outside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This observation requirement is built into the final assessment, which is an essay based comparing the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials with what the law expects, requires or assumes exists in relation to those participants.\nOutside classroom hours students must attend and observe criminal trials in progress. This enables students to not only learn about trial practice first hand but, with classroom discussion and the readings, better appreciate its relationship to doctrinal theory. The observation requirement is also built into the final assessment, which is an essay-based analysis with a choice between two topics. One topic asks students to compare the conduct and practices of participants in observed trials withwhat the law expects, requires or assumes. The other (alternate) topic requires students to explore a miscarriage of justice scenario of their own choice. Finally, a number of guest speakers, such as barristers and trial judges, will contribute to the course.\nMain Topics\nnotions of justice and process through history and architecturepre trialthe criminal charge: indictments and their problems.negotiating charges, negotiating silencedefending criminal charges &amp; disclosure and other challengeshuman rights &amp; the common law criminal trialprosecuting ethically: independence, fairness, disclosure.witnesses vs the right to testjudges and juriesappeals, innocence vs procedural justicecoronial inquiries",

The difficulties encountered with the multiplicity of authorities and interactions between local government regulations, state and federal laws and international law are considered. Case studies examined at each of these levels are used to provide a brief overview of current environmental law in Australia and the World, with examples. \u00a0\nThe aim of this course is to acquaint students with the fundamental principles of environmental law; and to explain how these principles are applied. The course assumes that participants have little or no background in the law, and so the course also provides some basic instruction about important legal concepts and structures as well as policy approaches to implementation of regulation and enforcement of the law. \u00a0\u00a0\nThe learning outcomes expected on the completion of this course include:\nDemonstrate knowledge of the various sources of environmental law and policyIdentify the influence of common law and international environmental law on the development of Australian lawExplain the structure of environmental laws and engage in critical analysis of the different methods, both regulatory and incentive based, that may be used to implement environmental policyDemonstrate comprehension of the different ways in which environmental disputes may be resolvedNavigate and apply knowledge of environmental planning and assessment processes in the context of natural resourcesDemonstrate awareness of the social and economic context in which environmental law and policy has to be made and recognise the various pressures and influences on the search for optimal environmental protection lawsDemonstrate effective oral communication skills by delivering accurate and insightful contributions in class;Demonstrate effective written communication skills by articulating legal and policy concepts clearly, persuasively and appropriatelyDemonstrate an ability to incorporate a range of legal and interdisciplinary research sources in written communication with appropriate referencing.\nMain Topics\u00a0\nlegal institutions and sources of lawinfluences on environmental policy and law: common law and international lawfederal environmental law\u00a0sustainable development\u00a0environmental planning and assessment\u00a0biodiversityresolving environmental disputes and enforcing environmental law",

As consumers, we purchase services every day \u2013 be they retail banking, using a supermarket or restaurant, a holiday, medical services, transportation, visiting immigration consultants, travel agents or hairdressers (higher education is also a service!). Professional services (of a B2B or B2C nature) are equally prominent and include legal services, financial planning, accountancy, architects, management consultancy, financial services, information technology, market research, and engineering services. Experiential services (tourism, sport, theatre) are also growing. However, it is important to remember that many product-based organisations (e.g., IBM, Federal Express) have a strong service component.\u00a0\nThis course was developed because for business, in any industry, service provision is a key differentiator. The implications of service provision, and how services are best managed and marketed, are steadily gaining importance. Therefore, students who plan to work in service industries, or the customer service division of manufacturing industries, must be prepared sufficiently to do so. This course aims to help students understand the practical implications of the unique characteristics of services and service provision and to help them cope with the challenges of marketing and managing a service. To achieve this aim, we build upon, and expand, marketing management concepts and models, demonstrating how they apply to the services sector. This course focuses on the\u00a0distinctive characteristics and problems of marketing in service organizations and for any organization developing and marketing services as part of its business portfolio. It demonstrates why and how services require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy-both in its development and in its execution. This course examines cases from commercial and not-for-profit organizations including banking, transportation, hotels, tourism, hospitals, education and professional services such as accountancy, engineering, and management consultancy. Anyone working in a service industry or for an organization with a strong commitment to customer service will find this course relevant.",

Increases in leisure time and discretionary spending have led to a proliferation of public events, celebrations, and entertainment, making the events sector one of the fastest growing segments of tourism in the world. Countries and cities compete vigorously for mega events such as the Olympics, World Cup, and World Fairs. Societies are increasingly holding smaller scale events such as fairs, festivals, community markets, parades, or sporting events. Governments support and promote events as part of their strategies for economic development and destination marketing as these events serve as a means of creating awareness of a destination and enhancing visitation. Most events require considerable investments on planning and organisation to ensure the maximum possible benefit for all stakeholders. Inappropriate management can lead to negative economic, environmental, and social impacts. This course thus provides students with knowledge and skills required for planning, managing, and staging events to realise positive outcomes",

In addition the course considers scholarly writing and communication style in marketing--including the uses and abuses of arguments and counter-arguments, narratives, diagrammatic models, graphs, and the presentation of data. Preparation of a conceptual paper of a refereed journal standard based on a focused and critical literature review will enable these ideas and concepts to be implemented.",

Vectors and vector geometry are further developed from high school and matrix algebra introduced.\u00a0 Linear equations are treated with Gaussian elimination and matrix methods, and these are used for applications such as basic input-output linear models and least squares approximation.

The concepts such as spans, linear independence, basis, dimension, kernel, image are studied in both abstract and concrete examples, with links made to data fitting and differential equations.\u00a0 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are studied along with their applications to Markov chains and systems of differential equations. In calculus, further techniques of integration and the theory and applications of first and second order ordinary differential equations are studied, including existence and uniqueness results and numerical methods. Double integrals, including change of variables are introduced. Convergence results for sequences and series are developed along with Taylor polynomials in both one and two variables and their applications.\u00a0 Optimisation techniques, including classification of critical points and Lagrange multipliers are studied.\u00a0",

        "description": "Linear algebra is a key tool in all of mathematics and its applications. For example, the output of many electrical circuits depends linearly on the input (over moderate ranges of input), and successfully correcting the trajectory of a space probe involves repeatedly solving systems of linear equations in hundreds of variables. Linear methods are vital in ecological population models, and in mathematics itself. You have met systems of linear equations and matrices, vector spaces and linear transformations in first year Mathematics courses, without necessarily understanding all the subtleties involved. In MATH2501, you will review the material from first year, so that vector spaces and linear transformations become familiar friends rather than uneasy acquaintances. You will learn about geometric transformations: projections\n(which can also be viewed as least squares approximations), rotations and reflections. You will see how to view many linear transformations as being made up of &#34;stretches&#34; in various directions, (the diagonalisation process), and the more general Jordan form. This will allow you to calculate functions of matrices (such as the exponential of a matrix) and hence to solve systems of linear differential equations.\n",

        "description": "Mathematics went through quite a revolution around the turn of the 20th century. In particular, an axiomatic approach infiltrated the mathematical paradigm, both as a tool to ensure mathematical rigour and to abstract common principles working in a variety of different settings.\n\nFirst year mathematics emphasizes computation over abstraction and rigour. Later year courses (and Pure Mathematics in general) reverse this, so students need to learn some new skills and some new ways of thinking about mathematical objects.\n\nThis course is designed to help you develop the ability to write rigorous mathematical proofs in a setting where the level of abstraction is still quite modest. As such it will serve as an excellent preparation for the third year Pure Mathematics courses.\n\nThe course consists of two halves, algebra and analysis, each taught for 6 weeks.\nAnalysis half. Most of the calculus you have seen involves equalities. Mathematical analysis\u00a0however, is largely about inequalities, about suitably bounding quantities that cannot be calculated precisely. Many nice examples come from geometry and we will frequently use these to motivate our discussion in the first part of the analysis section. In the latter part we will look\u00a0more closely at some aspects of the real numbers, such as how well one can approximate \u03c0 by a rational p/q\u00a0(in terms of how large q\u00a0is).\n\nAlgebra half. We will investigate various transformations on the plane and projective plane. We will first study several types of transformations such as translations, reflections, rotations etc. in terms of groups. We will then look at symmetries, i.e. transformations of geometric figures that\u00a0preserve some property (such as distance or angles between lines), and projective geometry. Projective transformations can change a conic section of one type to another, e.g. an ellipse to a hyperbola.\n",

        "description": "This course builds on MATH2120 Mathematical Methods for Differential Equations in that it is concerned with ways of solving the (usually partial) differential equations that arise mainly in physical, biological and engineering applications.\n\nAnalytical methods have considerable intrinsic interest, but their importance for applications is the driving motive behind this course. The main analytical tools developed in this course can be thought of as generalisations of the Fourier and power series representations of functions studied in MATH2120. This leads to new types of functions and to practical methods for solving differential equations. We will pay special attention to functions defined on infinite domains.\n\nThe course begins by characterising different partial differential equations (PDEs), and exploring similarity solutions and the method of characteristics to solve them. The Fourier transform, the natural extension of a Fourier series expansion is then investigated. For functions of time, the Fourier transform corresponds to the \u201cspectrum\u201d of the function or signal in the problem in the frequency domain. Closely related to the Fourier transform is the Laplace transform which is particularly useful for solving the initial value PDEs that arise in many physical applications. Although contour integration is an intrinsic part of using these transforms, only brief references to complex variable methods will be made.\n\nTransforms give a wide insight into the behaviour of a function and suggests other possibilities for the integral representation of solutions of PDEs. By exploiting certain special solutions of a given linear PDE we eventually obtain the idea of a Green&#39;s function for the PDE and a corresponding integral form for the solution. The power of Green&#39;s functions can be observed in their use as the inverses of differential operators on both infinite and bounded domains.\n\nFrequently it is not possible to evaluate in closed form the Fourier, Laplace or Green\u2019s function integrals appearing in the solution of the given PDE. All is not lost as we can still explore the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals at large parameter values and obtain physically useful information on the solution of the underlying problem.\n",

        "description": "Limits and continuity are the central concepts of calculus in one and several variables. These concepts can be extended to quite general situations. The simplest of these is when there is some way of measuring the distance between two objects. Some of the most important examples of these &#96;metric spaces&#39; occur as sets of functions, so this course looks at ways in which one might say that a sequence of functions converges. Taking these ideas one step further, we look at convergence which does not come from a generalised distance function. These are the ideas of point set topology. The course includes topics such as countability, continuity, uniform convergence and compactness, as well as an introduction to the core areas of function analysis.\u00a0\n",

We prove the important Gauss-Bonnet theorem and use it to examine topological properties of surfaces, such as the Euler Characteristic.\n\nThis course is part of the core Higher Pure Mathematics sequence MATH3711/MATH3611/MATH3701 which is designed to be taken in that order.

The most fundamental notion is that of a group, which is how mathematicians study symmetry. In this course groups are studied in detail both from an abstract point of view and also to study symmetry in geometry. The other important concept studied is that of a ring. The algebra of adding and multiplying matrices has many similarities with the algebra of numbers. The notion of rings generalises both these two examples. The course examines factorisation theory for certain rings.",

In this course you will focus on the conceptual design and analysis of serious games. This context will shape an investigation into game aesthetics, learning, affect and engagement. You will also be introduced to the methods and practice of game play-testing. The course does not involve any computer programming or require any previous knowledge in this area.\n",

But communication is never as clear-cut as that. Something as seemingly-straightforward as &#39;writing&#39; in fact has a visual component (how it looks), and a material component (what it is produced on and with). And we also communicate through many other modes - such as through the design of objects and buildings, the sorts of networks we create through digital media, or the actions we undertake in daily life. In this course, you will extend your understanding of communication by investigating underlying principles of communication design, the range of modes we communicate with, and the complex nature of all forms of communication. We will investigate particular modes in depth, and explore how they work together. You will develop research skills which allow you to critique and evaluate the design of multimodal communication, especially in terms of its contribution to contemporary society.",

It consists of two separate but interlinked health scenarios, the first on immunisation for medical students, and the second on stomach pain. The teaching and learning methods are designed to incorporate issues such as information management, and written and oral communication. The Foundations course also provides an orientation for new students into the academic support and mentoring programs.

The aim of the course is to develop basic skills in communication, medical interviewing and physical examination.\nThese skills will be taught in weekly 2 hour turorials in the Clinical Skills Centre on Campus. Clinical tutors and communication skills tutors will provide an integrated approach to teaching these skills. The teaching of basic communication skills will be addressed in simulated clinical consultations to ensure that the relevance of generic skills is understood within the context of medical practice. These simulated consultations will also be used to address concepts of the medical history and the patient-centred approach. Existing anatomical models and graphics will be used to introduce concepts of surface anatomy and functional anatomy underpinning the physical examination. Similarly, the relevance of normal physiology to the physical examination will be addressed.\nStudents will be required to attend all sessions and to have completed preparatory activities. The students will be expected to reach a satisfactory level of performance based on continuous assessment in simulated clinical consultations. Students will also be required to satisfactorily complete the communications assessment. Students who fail to attend this course will have failed to meet the requirements to enter the medicine program. If a student fails the communication assessment, they will be allowed to resubmit after remedial work to improve their communication skills. It is acknowledged that these students will have had little opportunity to develop these skills and, if necessary, further remediation will be provided after they enter the medicine program.",

In addition, students will develop understandings of the population health aspects of relevant illnesses and the role of other health professionals and community-based services in prevention of illness and addressing the social and environmental determinants of health. Students will also extend their capabilities in communication with, and assessment of, individual patients and population groups with specific health issues. Typical environments and/or experiences will include sexual health and infectious disease services, services for particular population groups such as indigenous people, refugees, homeless people, community specialist services such as drug and alcohol, diabetes, infectious disease, respiratory, or public health services that focus on health care based in the community and preventative approaches. Clinical experiences will be augmented by a range of tutorials, laboratory classes, and face-to-face and/or electronic resources covering aspects of public health, community medicine, pathology, infectious disease and pharmacology. Assessment will include submission of a project report, demonstrating integration/ correlation of prior and current learning with linkage to basic biomedical sciences; medical imaging and diagnostic tests; social and behavioural determinants of health, ethics; or population health issues. Objectives of Adult Health 1 Term: - By using authentic clinical or practical experiences as the basis for learning, students will build upon their understanding of the internal and external mechanisms that maintain health or lead to disease. In addition, students will develop understandings of the clinical aspects of relevant illnesses, whilst extending their capabilities in communication with, and physical examination of, patients with specified health issues. Major organ systems such as the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, will be studied in a clinical context covering acute, chronic and complex presentations, supported by teaching in the basic and social sciences.Objectives of the Oncology Term: - By using authentic clinical or practical experiences as the basis for learning, students will build upon their understanding of the specific health issues faced by patients with cancer. In addition, students will develop understandings of the clinical aspects of oncology, whilst extending their capabilities in communication with, and physical examination of, patients with specified health issues. Typical clinical issues encountered will include simple and complex co-morbidity problems in common cancer medicine, palliative care and terminal illness.For Integrated Clinical Studies 1, a case-based teaching methodology is employed to link acquisition of clinical and public health capabilities with the learning of mechanisms and principles underlying health and illness. Approximately 60% of available time will be spent in clinical and community environments associated with the Faculty of Medicine, in which students will encounter patients or health issues relevant to the domain themes. These experiences will be augmented by a range of tutorials, laboratory classes, and face-to-face and/or electronic resources. Assessment will include submission of group projects and assignment reports, demonstrating integration/ correlation of prior and current learning with linkage to basic biomedical sciences; medical imaging and diagnostic tests; ethics; or population health issues. In addition, the student&#39;s clinical performance during the module will be graded as satisfactory/unsatisfactory.",

All students will enrol in MFAC3501-3509 and may enrol in additional courses, depending on whether they have undertaken earlier individualised study programs or have been granted any exemptions.\n\nObjectives: By completion of Phase 3, students will be expected to demonstrate an integrated achievement of the eight desired capabilities specified as appropriate for graduates to practice as interns. These include a thorough understanding of the biomedical science mechanisms and bio-social determinants that maintain health, contribute to illness, and underlie appropriate management strategies; application of a scientific approach to clinical medicine and medical practice; excellent communicative, teamwork, psychomotor and cognitive skills to assess health issues and patient problems and develop patient-centred management approaches; and demonstrated abilities to work independently, reflectively and within appropriate ethical and legal frameworks.\n\nClinical learning in phase 3 will be predominantly located in clinical environments associated with the Faculty of Medicine in a range of metropolitan and rural locations throughout New South Wales. Most modules will be available in a variety of clinical locations and students will be able to select an individualised learning program from a menu offered by clinical teaching units, or they may be able to negotiate their program with their clinical supervisors. Students will generally be able to indicate a preference to do the majority of their clinical training attached to one geographical region, but final allocation will be determined by a number of factors including availability of attachments to particular locations, and is ultimately the responsibility and decision of the Faculty.\n\nStudents are required to complete one each of six clinical modules with a specified major focus, these being in the clinical disciplines of Children&#39;s Health; Women&#39;s Health; Mental Health; Internal Medicine; Surgery; and Chronic &amp; Complex Care, although some choice of the structure, case-mix and location of each of these will generally be possible. In addition to these specified modules, students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete phase 3 requirements. The order and content of work undertaken in these courses will be organised for each student on an individual basis through the relevant Clinical School(s).\n\nIn considering their choice of modules in Phase 3, the student&#39;s clinical experience must include a minimum of 8 weeks in community or ambulatory settings, as well as 8 weeks experience of emergency or critical care, although these may be spread over one or more individual modules. In addition, a student&#39;s combined clinical experiences during phases 2 and 3 must include a minimum of 8 weeks in rural locations, 4 weeks in primary care practice and adequate exposure to various clinical sub-specialities.\n\nAll clinical modules in phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached. Although structured teaching activities are generally limited to an average of 10 hours per week, which will include teaching of relevant biomedical sciences and social sciences, students are required to work under supervision as part of the health care delivery unit. Students&#39; responsibilities as part of the team will increase gradually as new skills are developed. Each module will have demonstrable links to those aspects of basic biomedical and social sciences relevant to the health issues encountered.\n",

        "description": "The two  courses [MFAC 4508 and MFAC 4509] collectively  comprise the Independent  Learning Project and must be taken  consecutively.  After completing Phase 1, all students  (unless exempt)  will be required to undertake an Independent Learning Project  (ILP).   In the same year as the ILP, the students will also complete 12 units of credit  (UoC) in courses  offered by Faculties other than the Faculty of Medicine to meet General  Education requirements and the Clinical Transition course (MFAC 2507).  In order to  complete these  requirements, the 24 week ILP will be  staggered over both semesters.  Objectives:  To enhance  students&#39; abilities for independent learning, critical analysis and   research. During  the course of their ILP the students will be expected  to achieve the following  specific goals:(1)      An  ability and  inclination to question the basis of current scientific thinking in   relation to medical and public health practice.(2)      To  retrieve literature on a topic and demonstrate a familiarity with the use of  medical databases.(3)      To  evaluate current knowledge in a field and to provide a critical appraisal of  that body of knowledge.(4)       To  identify a problem in their chosen field and to understand and  participate in  the process of designing a scientific investigation of  the problem.(5)      To be  aware of the ethical issues involved in  medical research and be able to write an  ethics proposal for their  proposed study.(6)      To  critically evaluate data including the appropriate use and interpretation of  statistics.(7)       To  communicate findings and interpretations in their chosen  field, both orally and  in writing with experts, peers, the media and  general public.(8)      To  appreciate the implications of research findings in health decision making and  medical practice.The  ILP will offer scope for  in-depth study in a variety of possible  settings and fields of study. Some  examples include laboratory-based  work in the biomedical sciences,  audits of clinical practice, projects   dealing with cross-cultural issues, as well as projects dealing with  medical law  or ethics and health economics.   Although there is considerable  flexibility in the choice of topic, all projects must involve;(1) identification of an issue and related  questions relevant to the field or environment where learning will  occur; (2) a review and critical analysis of literature  or practice relevant to the issue;(3) articulation of an approach to address the  issue, including consideration of ethical issues; (4) a period of research or scholarship in which  the issue is explored or investigated; and (5) evaluation, communication and presentation of  the results of in-depth study.During the ILP, a series of lectures, tutorials and workshops  will be delivered to introduce students to research methodology in both  quantitative and qualitative research projects, to develop skills in  statistical analyses and scientific writing.Assessment will  include the components of  progressive assessment (on completion of MFAC 4508) and a report  submitted at the conclusion of the project  (i.e. on completion of MFAC  4509). In addition, the supervisor will grade the student&#39;s overall  performance (at the completion of MFAC 4509)",

Because successful career management has been empirically linked to intrinsic and extrinsic career satisfaction, career management skills should be learned and practiced. To do so necessitates first an understanding of the extant career literature and how you can apply it to your career path. To this end, concepts, techniques, tools, and processes are explored, with an emphasis on linking theory and empirical research with practical lifelong skill development.\n",

We will examine viral structure, classification, molecular virology, laboratory diagnosis, and applications of viruses in biotechnology. The pathogenesis of viral diseases is discussed in the context of virus-host interactions, as is viral persistence, transmission and control of viral infections in the community. The course will outline the common steps used by viruses for successful replication within a host cell, by using examples taken from a set of representative significant animal and human viruses. Studying virology enables a deeper understanding of the function of molecules, cells and has provided fundamental understanding of molecular and cell biology in general.\n\nPracticals are designed to provide students with opportunities to see how antivirals are developed, analyse viral structure and explore viruses using molecular biology, serology and viral culture techniques. Viral evolution and recombination will also be dissected using bioinformatic approaches. An online component of the course allows students to engage in on-line computer activities including group discussions. The final &#34;consultancy brief&#34; project provides students with an opportunity to gain experience in working in consultancy teams to facilitate research on a current topic in virology for a &#34;client&#34;, and produce a professional report and a short seminar.\n\nNote: It is highly recommended that students\u00a0take BIOC2201.\u00a0\n",

It must be charged like all of your electronic devices. But how is the electricity produced? Whether it is from renewable energy sources or not, they all rely on metals and minerals to operate or to be built. Wherever you look you see metals and minerals and as remote as it may seem, all these goods started in a pit. In this course you will develop an awareness for the importance of the mining industry in our lives. Together, we will explore how commodities are extracted from the ground and who are involved at various stages of the mining operation. The topics covered in this course are geology, mining, mineral processing, safety, the impact of mining on the environment, and economics. We will also discuss employability in the mining industry, which employs people of various backgrounds (e.g. geologists, mining engineers, civil engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, process &amp; chemical engineers, lawyers, finance, etc.) and offers competitive salaries.

The course will integrate the technical, economic, and management content presented earlier in the mining engineering program in the design and evaluation of a new mining project while taking account of industry standards, community expectations and government requirements. Technical design, project evaluation and assessment of the socio-political impacts of the project are a core focus of the course. Due to the scope of work involved, the project is undertaken by teams of students. The teams are required to prepare and present a feasibility study of a mining project. Teamwork, project management and presentations skills are assessed in addition to the technical analysis and content of the final feasibility study.\nOn completion of the course, the student should be capable of demonstrating an understanding of:\nmethodologies to evaluate the viability and risks associated with metalliferous mining projects;range of software tools to assist in design, scheduling, modelling and evaluation of a metalliferous mining project;the theoretical principles and practical methodologies associated with mine planning and feasibility study projects;appreciation of the sustainability aspects of mining;technical writing and oral communication skills; andmanagement of project work by teams.",

This foundation provides a basis on which to design a solution that is robust and safe, cost effective and appropriate to the end-user.It is essential that this foundation reflects not only established thinking and practices but equally important, it should account for divergent and newly developing views as well as any limitations or weaknesses that underpin current understanding. The quality of the engineering solution is therefore a function of the quality and timing to complete this investigation; an investigation that forms part of a process known as research.The course entails the second phase of the Research Project that begun with Mining Research Project I, the focus of which was planning of the Project. With planning completed, the focus of the current course moves to the investigation, analysis and reporting phase. This entails one or more elements of equipment/model/survey design and build; experimentation and data gathering; analysis and modelling of data; conclusion and linking back to project objectives; and, finally presentation of project outcomes.On completion of this course, the student will have an  understanding of the process of scientific research.

        "description": "Professional Engineering and Communication is a subject designed to expose and involve students in a wide variety of topics and tasks which will be of lasting use going into Industrial Training, the final year thesis, and beyond that, a career in engineering. This course focuses on the non-technical aspects of engineering practice that centre around communication, ethical considerations, and professional conduct. Skills relating to problem solving, research, team working, and project planning and basic management will developed to standards expected of graduates entering the workplace - students are then expected to utilise and build on these skills in their final year to provide them with high-level skills that will make them sought after in the employment market.  Despite their non-technical nature, the concepts involved in this course are just as challenging as those that are involved in the technical analyses with which most engineering students are more familiar. A professional engineer can expect to find herself or himself working on several memos, reports and presentations at any given time - it is an essential part of performing effectively in industry. Therefore many tasks will be undertaken, some short and relatively simple, with others more complex and nuanced, partly reflecting the timelines and pressures of the working environment and providing an opportunity to work in different teams on different tasks. Analysis of team structures and interpersonal communication also forms part of the course, as aspects of teamwork such as leadership, conflict resolution, managing differing technical skill levels and cultural backgrounds are vital in professional practice and must be appreciated as useful skills for the engineer.  The centrepiece of the course is a group research project on an area pertinent to modern engineering. This, along with guest lectures from industry professionals will be used to provide insight into the working relationships between professional engineers, clients and management in order to prepare students for the workforce.",

Over the last few years we have seen mass bleaching events and unprecedented levels of coral mortality around the world. Like many other ecosystems, coral reefs are under threat from a warming and acidifying ocean. To mitigate against future damage, we need to understand these threatened ecosystems, how they are affected by the physical and chemical environment, and how threats can be reduced to converse the coral reef systems.\nThis course aims to provide you with that broad understanding of the systems, threats and conversation efforts. You will learn about\u00a0\u00a0the components that make up a coral reef system: the coral animal/plant symbiosis, fish, algae, invertebrates and larger mammals, and the interactions between them. You will also learn about the physical environment: temperature, ocean currents, ocean chemistry that strongly affect the coral system, the climate change and how all these systems are being affected by climate change. Finally, you will investigate major threats faced by coral reefs and explore how we can manage and conserve these ecosystems.\nThe course will be delivered in a combination of online and on-field modes. You will be able to access online modules to gain an understanding of the coral ecosystems and prepare for the\u00a0\u00a0field trip at Lady Elliot Island Reef Resort. On the island you will be introduced to the incredible flora and fauna and conduct a field experiment on the reef.\nThe course will include a compulsory field trip to Lady Elliot Island that will incur personal costs to students.",

Universal though these truths might appear to be, the various musical expressions of the world\u2019s peoples are as diverse, unique, and sometimes strange, as the natural and cultural worlds that make them. Today we can access that musical diversity easily. We can buy it, download it, iPod it. But just how much do we know about the peoples, histories, sentiments, and lives of the musicians and singers that produce this music? How much do we grasp the beauty, the yearning, and the spirituality in that music? What can we learn that will deepen our appreciation, understanding, and perhaps performance of the many musical expressions available to us today?\n\nThis World Music course surveys and examines the relationships between music, the society in which it is performed, and individual selves. It explores both traditional and contemporary music of Aboriginal Australia, South-east Asia, India, Central Asia and the Middle East, West Africa and the Caribbean, and marginal Europe. It examines how musical practices express, shape, and allow for the individual and collective construction and negotiation of identity, ethnicity, gender, spirituality and class. It investigates how transformations in music both as social practice and as sound chart responses to modernity, state intervention, globalisation, conflict, dispossession and migration. The course also fosters direct experience of music in diverse cultural contexts through field work.\n",

        "description": "Most of us have experienced those magic moments when sounds and rhythms (grooves) move the body and set in motion interactions between musicians, dancers and audiences. But what do musicians do with their bodies, voices and instruments to get other bodies toe-tapping, dancing, or moshing? How do musicians and listeners become one, a communion, or a rite? We begin to answer these questions with the understanding that musical sound is a powerful force for social interaction (grooves, in a broader sense). At the same time, we address these questions with the understanding that here is no simple relationship between what musicians produce and the social and cultural meanings ascribed to their productions. Popular music may also be considered as a cultural text that is read, received, and interpreted by both individuals and groups.\nThis course covers a wide variety of popular musics, ranging from the locally produced to the latest global trends, through a survey of the historical and social development of key genres, such as, blues, country, reggae, rock and roll, Motown, soul, hard rock, disco, hardcore, metal, grunge, techno, rap and Latin forms.

The fieldtrip will take place primarily in the traditional village of Bona in the Regency of Gianyar, a region renowned for its rich artistic and cultural heritage. Students will receive intensive gamelan instruction by leading local musicians. An introduction to Balinese dance is also an option for those interested in understanding the close relationship between Balinese music and dance.

Beginning with African American chants, field hollers, early blues and urban dance forms, this course traces a history of the music, outlining the development and details of various styles of jazz, both in the United States and abroad. Tracing the changing locations in which the music has developed, it examines the roles of individual artists and musical collectivities in the innovation of styles. It investigates the dissemination of jazz through emerging media technologies, and notes the influence of other music on jazz musicians: popular music, rhythm and blues, soul, rock, classical music and world music, such as Latin American music, French gypsy music, South African kwela and mbqanga. As jazz has become the scintillating soundtrack to many lives, the course examines both the practical use of jazz as sound and image in film, literature and the visual arts, and some of the many meanings listeners have ascribed to it. The course introduces\u00a0you\u00a0to critical debates surrounding jazz: debates of race, authenticity, ownership, gender and commercialization. The course engages you in the process of informed listening.\n",

We will begin with orchestration, which transforms music for a single instrument into music that involves a stage full of performers.

The second part of the course revolves around a question: how have composers used old music to make new music? In answering this question we will focus on transformation itself, and we will examine in detail a wide range of recent re-compositions of earlier music (including Halvorsen, Ives, Berio, Schnittke, Nyman and Adams, for example). These will form models either for your own re-compositions, or for an essay about recomposition.",

It begins with an understanding of cell membranes and the mathematical equations that describe the movement of ions. It then builds a repertoire of the key molecules that underlie the processes of signalling in neural cells. These are then combined to understand the behaviour of neural cell signalling and how these may be manipulated experimentally to understand the function. Topic areas include: how electrical signals are generated across cell membranes; the function, properties and structure of ion channels, receptors and transporters; how nerve cells communicate with each other in the brain, including synaptic transmission and receptor-mediated signalling; how alterations in function can lead to disease states; modern experimental techniques in cellular neuroscience; application of molecular biology techniques to manipulate and explore the function of molecules in the nervous system. The course provides an ideal introduction for further studies in neuroscience and pharmacology, and provides a foundation for the understanding of higher physiological systems.\n\nFor more detailed information, please click on &#34;Course Outline&#34; in box below.\n",

Millions of dollars are spent by the Australian government and other countries each year on space exploration, so what do we\u00a0actually learn\u00a0from modern day telescopes and satellites?\u00a0In this course,\u00a0students will explore\u00a0an introduction to\u00a0the Universe and the study of astronomy. There is much that is unanswered in astronomy, and during the course\u00a0students will venture into current open questions and topics of active research in astronomy. Students will\u00a0gain a qualitative introduction to the physics of the universe from scales ranging to our Solar System and extrasolar planets to the origin and\u00a0ultimate fate\u00a0of the\u00a0Universe, gaining an understanding and appreciation both of what is known about the Universe and the techniques scientists use to\u00a0make discoveries. Students will also gain experience in effectively communicating knowledge to different audiences and in how to separate science fact from science fiction.\u00a0\u00a0\nTopics to be\u00a0covered\u00a0include:\u00a0astronomical techniques,\u00a0the history of astronomy across cultures,\u00a0the Big Bang\u00a0and beginnings of the\u00a0Universe, formation and evolution of galaxies, the\u00a0origin of life on Earth and search for life elsewhere, stellar structure and evolution, planet formation, black holes,\u00a0and compact objects.\nThis course is intended primarily as a general education subject with no assumed prior knowledge. Students wishing to proceed on to PHYS2116 and PHYS3116, or with a good prior background in physics and astronomy, may instead wish to take PHYS1116 Astrophysics, which is a more technical version of the subject intended for physics majors and science students.\u00a0",

This shows students an important application of basic physics (and a bit of chemistry), and for Oceanography, Meteorology and Climate students this will provide a necessary foundation upon which later courses will build. For instance, you will learn about the ozone hole, the greenhouse effect, how to use charts to determine the likelihood of storms developing, why deserts occur at certain latitudes, and how to use the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s radar images on its website to track thunderstorms. This course will also train students in how to apply basic principles of physics and mathematics (including calculus) to real-world problems and situations.

Change in the built environment invariably impacts on disadvantaged and disenfranchised groups disproportionately, where for example redevelopment and gentrification may be accompanied by quickly changing community profiles, rising housing costs, unhealthy environments and potential displacement. As planners we must steward the future direction of our cities and communities in ways which value and foster diversity. Planners must ensure that the interests and needs of all groups, including ethnic communities, children, the aged, women, people with disabilities, people of all sexual preferences, Indigenous and homeless people are heard. Planners are also increasingly engaged with the creation of healthy built environments, fostering wellbeing alongside health professionals in decisions taken which affect the built environment&#39;s ability to be supportive of healthy behaviour. The role and capacity of current planning frameworks to achieve more equitable and health supportive outcomes are explored, including the preparation of community strategic plans, the use of social and health impact assessments, as well as more creative inter-disciplinary and bottom-up consultative approaches and working practices.",

In Practice, students will quickly build awareness of the complexity of the policy process \u2013 both in terms of development and implementation \u2013 and in the critical role that governance issues play in shaping decision-making and outcomes. In this course students will reflect upon academic debate regarding the institutional frameworks and actors involved in policy making and implementation, and bring into the classroom real world examples from their respective experiences in practice. The course encourages students to critically reflect on the nature in which policy decisions get made, are enacted, how they impact upon planning activity and to help understand how and why decisions get made in the way that they do, or how we assess whether those policies succeed or not through monitoring and evaluation. Drawing upon the cohort\u2019s diversity of Practice experience, the course builds an appreciation of the actors and arenas, methods and institutions contributing to urban management and development so that students are able to engage with such processes effectively in professional life and be aware of the limitations and challenges that inevitable frame activity.\u00a0 \u00a0",

It seeks to integrate a range of relevant methodological issues into a foundation for major research investigations\u2014starting with the basics of research design. The approach taken in PLAN4001 is pragmatic and student directed. The course considers fundamental epistemological questions about research paradigms, explores the realities of the research process, and covers practical topics such as doing a literature review, writing and presenting a scholarly piece of work, applying ethical research protocol as per induvial topics, and finally, a review of Harvard referencing. Students gain an understanding of the conceptual, methodological, and technical bases for the construction and timely delivery of research projects. The primary focus of PLAN4001 is to prepare students for the substantive research project in T3 of the BCP student candidature. Lectures, tutorials and assessments guide students towards a developed thesis proposal and plan of study for PLAN4003.\n\nThe basic teaching model in PLAN4001 is a series of lectures and small group meetings in class and one-to-one meetings with the Course Lecturers. Class times will generally involve a presentation by the Course Lecturer (2-3 hours) accompanied, where feasible, by a mix of informal discussion/workshop sessions in which students will be actively engaged\u2014sometimes with the class divided into smaller groups appropriate to the timeframe. These components facilitate a degree of learning from your peers (you are all bringing a diverse range of professional experiences to your final year). One-to-one meetings with Course Lecturers assist with individual planning topic queries.\n",

Psychologists and biologists have a different view \u2013 that attraction and love are encoded by hormones and other chemicals activating brain systems of reward and connections with others. Yet, we all agree that sex, love, and attraction exert powerful effects on our lives by shaping our romantic partnerships, our desire to reproduce, and how we parent our offspring.\n\nIn this course you will be introduced to the study of sex, love, and attraction in humans and other animals from a broad-based perspective including comparative, psychobiological, cross-cultural, and evolutionary approaches. Along the way, you will learn about physiological, behavioural, cognitive, and social factors involved in sex, love, and attraction. An emphasis of the course is placed on evolutionary concepts and how these could be used to interpret sex, love, and attraction. This course will enable you to gain a better understanding of evolutionary psychology and apply principles from this discipline to examine various issues related to sex, love, and attraction such as relationships, sexual behaviour, social monogamy, paternity, parenting, and menopause.\n",

The Judgment and Decision-making strand asks and answers questions like: Do we make rational decisions? Are we constrained to fall prey to systematic biases when we make judgments? Are we risk averse and if so what does that mean? It will also cover the burgeoning field of \u201cbehavioural insights\u201d and the tools to \u2018nudge\u2019 people to change their behaviour. The Theory and Models strand focuses on the development and testing of computational models of cognitive processes, with an emphasis on models of working memory and long-term memory. The component is focused on how quantitative instantiations of models are necessary to provide a rigorous test of psychological theories. The Categorisation and Reasoning strand examines how and why people organise things in their physical and social environment into groups (e.g., dogs vs. cats, male vs. female, left-wing politician vs. right-wing politician?), and how they use such knowledge to reason and make predictions. The Intelligence and Thinking strand will address questions like: What is intelligence? Do IQ tests really measure intelligence (and if not, what DO they measure)? How do people use their past experience to solve new problems?\n",

Investigating how design has both reflected and constructed notions of home , literally and metaphorically, we will encounter many different lived experiences, including those of indigenous peoples, women, children and migrants.\u00a0Dreams of Home explores these experiences through the lenses of urban, architectural and interior design history, analysing domestic artefacts such as ceramics, textiles, furniture and lighting, examining domestic spaces such as the parlour, patio, garden and courtyard, and considering domestic activities from the garage sale to the backyard barbie and the TV dinner. In the classroom you will read and discuss key texts, and in the field you will carry out site and artefact analysis. Crucially, you will encounter domestic experience through the voices of those who have lived them: in addition to reading historical accounts, you will be introduced to the practice of oral history, making recordings and analysing the accounts of the lived experience of the Australian home.\n",

To explore the possibilities of virtual space you will reconstruct and reconfigure virtual heritage environments-the phantom structures of the past-and also design the kinds of fantasy spaces that can only exist in the digital realm. You will develop skills in the design of virtual 3D models and learn to produce flythroughs and photorealistic visualisations using programs such as Vectorworks, Photoshop, and associated rendering software.\u00a0Assessment is based on your demonstrated ability to design virtual spaces and produce 2D representations that inform, excite and delight. The course is one of two 3000-level courses in the spatial design studio stream. It may also be taken as an elective, subject to availability and the completion of 2000-level courses in the spatial design stream.",

You will investigate a given situation or design context in response to nominated themes, issues or set of conditions specified in a socially-engaged design brief.\nThe course models professional studio practices by focusing on how designers and design function in society. You will work collaboratively in teams of people with different skill sets, drawing on a wide range of available knowledge and skills to produce an informed return brief, which is supported by relevant research, concept and material explorations. In order to realise project options for final presentation, the resulting Design solutions will integrate the needs of end users, identify and address constraints as well as syntehesise two or more fields of creative expertise to generate potentially unique and innovative ideas and outcomes.\nAssessment in this course is based on submission and evaluation of a three stage project development process including:\n1. Return brief and conceptual idea generation\n2. Iterative design development examining possible solutions\n3. Project contribution evidenced in final presentation\nThis course is available to all Year 3 BDes(Hons), BFA(Hons) and BMA(Hons) students studying one or more Design studios. You can take it either as an alternative to one of your Year 3 studio courses in Ceramic Design, Jewellery, Graphics Media, Spatial Design, Object Design and Textile Design, or choose it as an Elective in addition to completing your one or two 4-course Design studios.\u00a0\nTo enrol in this Level 3 course you must have previously completed two related Level 2 courses in at least one Design studio at Art &amp; Design, or the equivalent in another approved field of creative / professional endeavour.\n\n",

With the advent of discoveries, inventions and improvements in computer and communication technologies our society is increasingly being expected to deal and cope with vast amounts of information in the form of text and images, as well as sound, in the case of multimedia applications. The dissemination of information can now be achieved much faster than traditional print media via the digital environment. Access to the processing and promulgation of information is also made possible through the availability of computer equipment and software packages which are now priced reasonably within the financial reach of many individuals. This democratisation of information access has produced a profound impact on how information is being generated, packaged and communicated to society. The increased proliferation of unintelligible and uncommunicable information in both the print and electronic media, and cyberspace is a pertinent case in point. These issues will be explored in a series of lectures and tutorials which examine theory, methodology and case studies.\n",

Energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest, safest and simplest way to reduce emissions. This course covers the various methodologies, technologies and policies that can be used to reduce energy use, while still producing what that energy is needed for - heat, light and movement.Topics covered include current and predicted energy use and associated GHG emissions; residential and commercial passive solar design; energy management programs; building management systems; heating, ventilation and air conditioning; and consumer products and office equipment. The impacts of transport are also covered, together with opportunities to reduce transport energy requirements through more efficient engines, public transport, and urban design. Industrial systems examined include heat recovery; cogeneration; compressed air and steam distribution; and motor systems, pumps and fans. Efficient use of water, and increased efficiency of water supply can also significantly reduce energy use. Various government policy measures at the local, state, commonwealth and international level are covered in terms of their effectiveness and relevance in Australia. Finally, barriers to improved energy efficiency such as up-front cost, lack of information, and the low cost of energy in Australia are examined.Assignments focus on energy use and emissions produced at your home and by your transport to and from the UNSW, and will also analyse current energy practices at the UNSW.",

The focus of this course is on the tax treatment of taxable income and tax losses made through these three major entities. Even though tax policy suggests that similar treatment should be given to each economically equivalent entity, it is difficult to achieve this when designing operative tax rules. Hence, tax becomes a real factor in the all-important choice of entity question through which to operate an enterprise or hold investment assets. The course commences with some general law (non-tax) coverage of each entity, especially material factors in regard to the choice of entity question. It then moves to the income tax rules for each entity. Here the focus is on the tax rules relevant to the creation, operation and termination of partnerships, trusts and companies. The focus is on the tax rules that apply to closely held entities, and not widely held entities like listed trusts and listed companies.",

The intent is to challenge you to understand and adapt one or more of these perspectives to develop your own approach to deal with strategic issues such as business uncertainty, resource constraints, personnel management, and cultural change. The focus is on translating theoretical frameworks into practice through the analysis of organisational case studies, using such analysis as the foundation to develop practical insights into strategy implementation.\n",

The fluid mechanical knowledge assumed in the present course is the knowledge of the physical principles and, in particular, the conservation laws governing fluid flow and the forces exerted by fluids as they flow over solid objects.\n\nThe primary aim of this course is to impart knowledge and understanding of how wings and other bodies produce aerodynamic forces known as lift and drag in flight/motion. The course also aims at elucidating the physical origins of the more subtle aspects of the interaction between a fluid and a solid.\n\nAs flight speed rises, the physical behaviour of the flow around a solid body, such as an aircraft, alters markedly causing major changes in the forces the flow exerts on the body. Detailed understanding of flow behaviour is therefore vital for ensuring that an aircraft will behave as desired throughout the full range of its flight regime.\n\nA further aim is to have students experience the acquisition of non-intuitive knowledge that is not easily accessible. This fits into the whole program\u2019s underlying purpose to teach students how to learn.\n\nA third aim is to demonstrate that such apparently esoteric theory can inform us about flight in \u201cthe real world\u201d.\n",

The cameras can be mounted on driverless cars, UAV, aircraft or satellites. They form part of the big data to handle and to utilise for information mining and target detection. Digital image processing is a computer-based technique which carries out manipulation, enhancement, compression and representation of the information embedded. \u00a0Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can then be applied for target detection, classification and identification. The topics covered in this course are the key elements in computer vision and artificial intelligence for a wide range of applications in various disciplines and fields, including robot control, search and rescue, surveillance and Earth observation.\u00a0\n\nThis course covers basic concepts and fundamental methodologies applicable to digital image processing:\u00a0Image registration; image enhancement in spatial and spatial frequency domains; image coding and compression; deep learning, image segmentation and classification; applications in remote sensing, defence and security, law enforcement and space management.\n",

Finally, the methods of wind tunnel testing will be used to measure drag and compare with predictions.\u00a0 Concurrently with these activities, students will be conducting an individual open-ended design project related to their aircraft design.\n\nThis course is a 6 UOC capstone course and relies on the entire scope of knowledge gained in the undergraduate Aeronautical engineering and BTech Aero programs, with a particular focus on the Fundamentals of Flight, Structures, Controls, and Aerodynamics courses.\u00a0 The course places a heavy emphasis on group work, open-ended design, and oral communication skills.\n",

The user of the FE method has to decide what kind of elements should be used, and how many of them? Where should the mesh be fine and where may it be coarse? Can the model be simplified? How accurate will the answers be, and how can they be checked? One need not understand all the mathematics of the finite element to answer these questions. However a competent user must have an understanding of the preliminary mathematics and must be able to understand how elements behave in order to choose suitable kinds, sizes and shapes of elements, and to guard against misinterpretations and unrealistically high expectations. This course is a balanced theoretical and practical introduction to the use of the FE method. The first part deals with mathematical preliminaries such as the weighted residual methods, finite element approximation and numerical integration. The second part is an application of the finite element method to linear plane elasticity problems. The third part deals with heat transfer.\u00a0 All the lectures include computational work in which problems are to be solved using Matlab and ABAQUS.\n",

Beginning with a survey of the laws governing territorial disputes and the use of force, the course reviews the historical development of international humanitarian law, its key obligations, and the debate surrounding its creation. It then surveys a series of related ethical, legal and operational challenges raised by new forms of conflict and military operations including counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism, stability and reconstruction operations, humanitarian interventions and complex emergencies, conventional war-fighting, and air operations. Rather than narrowly treating ethical issues in terms of legal obligations, it explores how ethical questions have become central to strategic success.\n",

This course prepares them for doing so by developing a broad understanding of strategy, management and leadership in organisations.

It has generated great wealth, but its people have largely lived in poverty. It has enjoyed great power status since the 18th century, yet it has consistently felt itself under threat. It has grown to become the largest nation on earth, but it repeatedly seeks to extend its rule and influence beyond its borders. It has produced some of the greatest cultural icons in music, literature, architecture and art, but freedom of expression has rarely been a feature of its society. Its people have a remarkable kindness, yet generation after generation have been marked by seemingly intolerable suffering and repression. So how are we to understand Russia and its people?\nThis course takes a multi-dimensional approach to Russian history looking at its rulers, systems of government, people, culture, wars and society.\u00a0",

Do managers that sacrifice profits for the sake of mitigating social and environmental problems breach the trust of the shareholders that they have been appointed to serve? What are the moral requirements that marketing campaigns must adhere to? What rights do employees hold against their employers? Under what circumstances is it ethically appropriate to file for bankruptcy? Is it permissible to use bribery in cultures and markets where it normal and widely accepted? To what extent should free and voluntary commercial exchanges be coercively regulated by the state? In answering such questions, the law often provides little guidance.

This was a period in which the modern world took shape through an unprecedented series of technological, social and political changes, many of which first occurred in Britain. While progress came to be widely celebrated, many authors were also concerned that their contemporary world had become severed from its traditions and cultural heritage. A core element of this course will be to consider how literature of the period responded to the idea of being modern and to the cultural, social and political ramifications of modernity. The question was repeatedly asked \u2013 how should we understand progress? Authors examined include William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Thomas De Quincey, W.B Yeats, T.S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf.\n\u00a0",

It examines why the West\u00a0triumphed in the early modern period and why at the same time great eastern civilisations such as India and China declined. It covers the West\u2019s adoption of the system of slavery, the industrial revolution that began in Britain and extended to other European countries and the United States, and the development of capitalism. It looks into differences within capitalist countries and between rich capitalist countries and underdeveloped countries in the periphery. The course examines the contest between major economic ideas such as liberalism,\u00a0comparative advantage and socialist ideas; the causes and consequences of the Great Depression of the 1930s; and the effort led by the United States to reconstruct the non-communist world after World War II. We discuss winners and losers in the Golden Age of capitalism and a world divided between rich western economies, a less prosperous and centrally directed communist bloc and the\u00a0\u2019third world\u2019 of\u00a0under-developed countries.

It develops analytical skills in assessing the political dynamics of conflict management, resolution and reconciliation of specific case studies. Students will be introduced to the conceptual debates within the multidisciplinary field of ethnic studies and will be required to critically assess the political dynamics of specific case studies. Part I examines definitional debates about ethnicity and nationalism and considers the relationship between theory and policy. Part II compares and contrasts various political and social contexts where ethnic cleavages have become sources of conflict and those where communal differences have not led to conflict. In particular the claim that democracy and civil society offer some insurance against ethnic conflict will be scrutinised. Part III examines the international politics of ethnic conflict. Many contemporary ethnic conflicts have their origins in the legacies of imperialism. Modern forces such as globalisation have exacerbated or ameliorated the conditions for ethnic conflict. Part IV surveys strategies for the management, resolution and reconciliation between ethnic communities.",

Whether quelling rebellious tribes in far flung colonies or pursuing bandits across border regions, air power in its many forms has been an important component of irregular warfare. In this course our underlying concern is to explore the use of force in the international environment, particularly its use by states against non-state actors. The context for this examination is the use of air power in small, irregular and unconventional wars, since 1917. Wars against bandits, rebels, insurgents, terrorists and guerrillas. The course will investigate the historic use of air power through colonial and post-colonial settings to consider finally the challenges such wars pose for the employment of air power today.

Traditionally, studies in international security have assumed that states are the primary actors in world politics and that the focus of security should be concentrated on conventional military threats. Contemporary security studies challenges both assumptions. The course evaluates debates between conventional and critical security studies by exploring how security is an essentially contested concept and examining this proposition in terms of the importance of non-military issues and non-state actors. The main schools of thought are reviewed to develop conceptual tools that will be used to analyse a range of non-traditional security issues such as energy security, environmental security, ethnic conflict and health security.This is followed by a survey of non-state actors such as private security companies, non-governmental organisations, AI/robotics and multinational corporations.

        "description": "This course examines the way people shape spaces and, in turn, the way spaces shape people.\n\nThe use of space to legitimate some behaviours, whilst censuring others, has been recognised by both benevolent and despotic powers. The organisation of the city, for example, has been an important theme since antiquity. Plato, one of the West\u2019s most famous and influential philosophers, spent a good deal of thought on what constitutes the ideal city, who would be its legitimate and illegitimate inhabitants and who would govern it.\n\nIn modern times the goal of influencing behaviour through city planning is clearly evident. Modernists such as Baron von Hausmann and Le Corbusier and, closer to home, Walter Burley Griffin, recognised the role that space played in shaping the behaviour of individuals and in shaping the direction of society. Yet although space can be planned to some degree to direct people to act, speak and even think in certain ways, there are of course many other facets of human action that thwart the best laid plans. The unpredictability of human action ensures a constantly changing landscape, which can only be explained by understanding the interplay between people and space.\n\nThe material examined is topical in nature and includes Australian and international examples, with a focus on urban environments. This course is designed to open your eyes to different interpretations of places, events and behaviours.\n\nThe aim of the course, using real-world, student-driven case studies, is for you to have a deep appreciation of the relationship between environments and the behaviours and opportunities of people living in these environments. On the Field School to the Illawarra in particular, we will focus on the ways in which people\u2019s\u00a0subjectivity is influenced by the environments in which they live and work.\u00a0\n",

The latest scientific evidence shows that many of these challenges are being accelerated by planetary warming, which has led some commentators to describe Australia as a nation on the frontline of the unfolding climate emergency. Thanks to recent advances in biological, ecological and meteorological science, we now have a much better understanding of the physical processes associated with Australia\u2019s environmental challenges. What is less well understood, however, are the social and cultural dimensions of these challenges and the role these dimensions play in shaping discussions about how we respond.\nInformed by key debates in human geography, this course will provide students with a framework that will enable them to identify and analyse the human dimensions of environmental change across a variety of registers, from social identities and cultural imaginaries to political ideologies and economic agendas. Students will gain a critical appreciation of geography\u2019s uniquely holistic approach to environmental processes and its significance in bringing together diverse forms of environmental knowledge. Students will also have the opportunity to apply geographical ideas and frameworks to a range of Australian environmental challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity decline, drought, and bushfires.",

It develops an in-depth approach to research, emphasising the contextuality of knowledge, the complexity of lifeworlds and the diversity of human experiences. As such, Qualitative Research has been innovative in reversing top down and mechanistic modes of social enquiry and thus in redefining what counts as legitimate forms of knowledge.\nSpatial Science is a sub-discipline of Geography that includes the collection and interpretation of geographical data and remotely sensed imagery. It is used by almost all industries including the military, all levels of government, national parks, city planners and consultants. Remote sensing today involves satellites, aircraft and UAVs to record images of the environment. Spatial Science has radically changed our perceptions of the earth, our methods of data analysis, and our ability to solve social and environmental problems.\nBy the end of the course students will have developed a broad range of skills to conduct geographic research. In doing so they will be able to identify and utilise appropriate methodologies for a research project and its associated fieldwork activities. Specifically, the course will equip students in answering the following questions:\nWhat key procedures are necessary in the implementation of a research project?How do we acquire, process and critically evaluate qualitative and spatial data?How can we effectively write about and present empirical research findings?\u00a0",

The Data Analysis strand uses data from simple experimental and observational studies, and introduces graphical methods for data presentation and exploration. It discusses the important concepts of populations, samples and randomness, and explains how to relate sample values to population values and test claims about population parameters. Association between different measurements is quantified, and methods of modelling the relationship between two variables are studied. The Multivariable Calculus strand describes surfaces in three dimensions using contour plots, partial derivatives and the gradient vector. Of great importance is the location of maxima or minima of the function, leading to a discussion of the methods of optimisation for functions of several variables, especially when auxiliary constraints must also be satisfied. Case studies in both strands will illustrate how the mathematical tools operate in a wide range of disciplines including Geography, Chemistry, Physics and Oceanography. The computer package MATLAB will be used throughout the course, particularly for its powerful graphics capabilities.",

        "description": "Discrete Mathematics is a rapidly growing area of mathematics with many current and emerging applications. It is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete; in contrast with calculus which deals with continuous change.\nThe importance of Discrete Mathematics today lies in its numerous practical and relevant applications. It plays an essential role in modelling the natural world (e.g., the genome) and the technological world (e.g., the Internet), and in designing efficient solutions such as Internet routing protocols. It is commonly used in cryptography, computer security, electronic banking, algorithms, theory of computing, telecommunications, web search engines, to mention a few.\nEmphasis will be placed on developing techniques and uses in applications. Modelling of processes and phenomena which occur in economics and the physical, environmental and life sciences will be used as a vehicle throughout. Topics to be covered include: combinatorics and counting, proof by induction and recurrence relations, graph theory and networks, matrix arithmetic and Markov chains, logic and finite set theory.",

Before investigating the currents, the basic principles of ocean properties (potential temperature, salinity, and density) and ocean forces (gravity, pressure, pressure gradients, Coriolis, friction) will be examined along with the primary ocean dynamics and their balances (geostrophic flow and Ekman transport). This will provide understanding of the forces causing and influencing the currents and provide a framework for the Australian currents to be discussed. The basics of waves and tides will also be outlined, including the tides around Australia. There will be an oceanography field school.",

        "description": "Many nonlinear equations do not have explicit solutions. This course shifts the focus from finding explicit solutions to discovering geometric properties of solutions. It also recognises that even a small amount of nonlinearity in a physical system can be responsible for very complicated chaotic behaviour.\nThe fact that nonlinear systems do not guarantee regular or predictable behaviour is having a major impact on many fields of science and engineering, as well as mathematics. The discovery of chaos in simple dynamical systems changes our understanding of physical processes and has many practical applications including the understanding of the dynamics of the weather and climate, excitable media such as cardiac tissue and nerve fibres, population dynamics, transport in complex flow fields, to mention a few.\nThis course introduces the fundamentals of nonlinear dynamics with applications to physics, engineering, biology, and chemistry. It takes an intuitive approach with emphasis on geometric thinking, analytic and computational methods and makes extensive use of software packages, such as Matlab.",

The course aims to explain why there is a broad equator-ward flow in all the major ocean basins, except the Southern Ocean, and why there are strong, poleward-flowing boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream and the East Australia Current on the western boundaries. The production of turbulence in the oceans and its role in mixing is also examined. The discussion of mixing in the ocean normally includes Kolmogoroff and Batchelor lengths, molecular mixing and diffusive boundary layers; the logarithmic boundary layer and mixing lengths; vertical mixing by wind and tidal stirring; dispersion in the ocean, its measurement, and the Taylor mechanism.",

Even before it reaches the antenna the radiation must pass through cables and waveguides, and this also involves propagation and interaction. Fundamental to all of this are Maxwell&#39;s equations and an understanding of what they can tell us. The second part of the course provides an introduction to advanced materials with an emphasis on their structural and magnetic properties. The various structural states and phase diagrams are considered in terms of microstructure and its influence on mechanical properties. Finally, the basic theories of magnetism and the different types of magnetic materials are described and the use of modern magnetic materials is discussed with particular reference to permanent magnets, transformers, and data storage.",
