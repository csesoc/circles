        "overview": "Computer Science involves the study of the design, construction and uses of computer systems. It is concerned with the representation of data and data structures in computer systems and the design of algorithms for automatic manipulation of this information by programming languages and machine systems. It is very much concerned with the design and development of hardware and software tools by which computer applications may be developed, but not so much with the applications themselves. It is, however, noted that non-computing elements (such as human interface or psychological aspects) can often dictate the level of success of computing systems. At UNSW, particular emphasis is given to comprehension of the basic principles behind computing tools, operating systems, compilers and translators, and computer hardware.",

        "overview": "Biotechnology can be defined as the use of various biological processes to make products and perform services. In biotechnology, living cells and biochemical macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are applied in a rapidly expanding range of activities of direct benefit to society. Biotechnology is used for the production of pharmaceuticals, food and industrial chemicals, in the development of improved crops and livestock for farming, for environmental clean-up, and in forensics. Modern biotechnology makes practical use of the most recent scientific advances in areas such as molecular genetics and molecular cell biology.\nThe development of recombinant DNA technology has resulted in the ability to create, modify and improve industrial organisms and to produce large quantities of any useful protein. Based on this technology, biopharmaceuticals including hormones, vaccines, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents and new therapies for the treatment of cancer are being developed with the potential to revolutionise medicine. The sequencing of the human genome and the rapid emergence of high-throughput genomic and proteomic techniques is resulting in a surge of new drug targets. Translation of this advanced knowledge into useful therapies and improved medical practices requires the application of biotechnology.\nMicroorganisms and viruses are being modified for use in controlling plant and animal diseases and pests. Diagnostic kits are being developed for use in forensic science and in product identification and quality control. Genetic improvements in agriculture, plants and animals are becoming a reality, as is the control of inborn genetic disorders in humans. The ability to treat diseased and injured organs with replacement cells and tissues generated outside of the body is advancing rapidly.\nThe future for expansion in all the above areas is immense. Our ability to cope with many medical, environmental, agricultural and manufacturing problems in the 21st century will depend heavily on advances in biotechnology.",

        "overview": "The Bachelor of Information Systems (BIS) is a highly valued and accredited business qualification offering students a career-focused education in Information Systems (IS). Organisations are always looking for &#39;business savvy&#39; IS graduates who understand both the business and technical issues related to their systems. This three-year degree is designed for students interested in the practical application of technology in business and government.\nInformation Systems relates to the interaction between technology, people and processes to achieve business goals. This can include internal applications of technology such as networks and Information Technology (IT) services that help those who work for organisations operate more efficiently, as well as external applications such as technological products and user experiences. IS professionals are in the business of transformation, working in teams to understand data, solve problems, optimise systems, create innovations, and enrich organisational workflows. Through the BIS degree, you will learn from leading academics and business experts in Information Systems to become an adaptive thinker, solve problems through a variety of digital technologies and tools, and drive purposeful change required to thrive in a fast-changing and increasingly digital world.\nThe BIS degree now includes an Integrated First Year (IFY) experience, allowing you to begin your study with other students in the business school. You will learn about business management and the broader environment in which an organisation operates, with a focus on developing professional skills and capabilities. The BIS now also offers a work integrated learning (WIL) course. WIL enables you to engage in\nauthentic, purposeful, partnered, supervised\nand\nassessed\nwork learning experiences that integrate academic learning with its application in the workplace.\nThe core BIS courses cover discipline specific competency areas that prepare you for a career as an IS graduate. This includes the study of\nDesign and Development\nand\nOrganisational IS such as\nBusiness Analysis, Agile Product Management, User Experience (UX) and IT Service Design, IS Project Management, as well as Business Process Management. In addition, you will undertake studies in\nData &amp; Information Management , including courses that will develop your knowledge and skills in Databases (SQL), Database Management, Big Data, and programming for analytics (R and Python). The core IS curriculum also prepares you for a career in Technology/Security related areas of business, and the study of Networking and Security, Cyber Security Management and Governance as well as Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Solutions. Finally, you will conclude your core study of IS through an\nIntegration\nand capstone project course. This course will synthesise your learnings across the program, requiring you to complete an authentic, sandbox project that closely relates to professional and collaborative work in the field. The BIS degree also offers a number of technical elective courses for students looking to further their data analytic or programming skills (Java and Android app development).\nOnce you have successfully completed the BIS degree, you will be able to pursue a career in the following areas: digital transformation, IT consulting, business systems analysis, User Experience (UX) design, information system design, communications network analysis, IS security development, cybersecurity consulting, digital innovation, data science, IS and IT architecture, database administration, and infrastructure development and maintenance.\nHigh performing students can study an additional Honours year for more advanced studies in Information Systems, including the completion of an honours research thesis project.",

        "overview": "Economics is an influential social science that explores human behaviour and decision-making, with a focus on the roles played by incentives, resource constraints, laws, customs, and institutions. When you study the Bachelor of Economics at UNSW, you ll explore how the decisions of institutions and individuals interact to determine outcomes for the economy and society.\nAs a graduate of economics, your distinct insights can be applied broadly. Through this degree, you&#39;ll gain highly transferable analytical skills that are valuable in a diverse range of careers.\nIn addition to more traditional economic issues like unemployment, taxation, and trade policy, economics allows you to understand and address human challenges like inequality, climate change, corruption, political polarisation, and impediments to education and health care.\nKey features\nLearn how to change the world\nYou ll explore and find solutions to the important issues of our time. Economics uncovers the forces behind global inequality and the drivers of international relations. It explores policymaking and regulation, inflation, property rights, labour markets, our interaction with the environment, firm organisation and competition, and strategic interaction.\nBecome highly sought after by industry and government\nUNSW Economics graduates are keenly sought after by policymakers at all levels of government, private sector employers, not-for-profits, and international organisations. They work in diverse careers as analysts, researchers, forecasters, journalists, and advisors.\nBuild your expertise\nOur flexible program allows you to shape your degree around your interests and goals. Choose from three specialisations in economics, build your own program, or complement your economics studies with other Business and Commerce courses. You can also study this program as a double degree to combine your expertise.\nPut theory into practice\nYou ll apply your academic learning through practical experience, empowering you to use economics and leadership to change the world. Opportunities for practical experience include internships, group consulting projects, and global practicums.",

Phase 1 commences with the Foundations course, followed by 7 x 8 week courses focussing on basic medical sciences in relation to the human life cycle; social, ethical and legal issues related to health care; and early experience in clinical or other health-related environments. During this phase, students will undertake a variety of learning activities involving students from different stages of the program working collaboratively in small groups.\nPhase 2 consists of 2 x 16-week courses, with increased clinical content and an emphasis on correlation between prior and current learning.\nDoctor of Medicine (MD)\nThe MD includes the Independent Learning Project (ILP), followed by a Clinical Transition Course prior to the Phase 3 courses. During the Independent Learning Project students should also complete 12 UOC of General Education courses in a faculty or faculties other than Medicine.\nPhase 3 consists of 10 x 8-week courses with a clinical focus, but still includes relevant content from the basic medical sciences and the social sciences. Students are required to complete a course in the disciplines of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, Primary Care, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Children&#39;s Health (Paediatrics). Students may choose from a range of other available clinical modules to complete Phase 3 requirements. In addition, a student&#39;s clinical experiences during Phase 3 must include a minimum of 4 weeks in a rural location. All clinical courses in Phase 3 adopt the principles of clinical clerkship, in which students learn through experience and participation in the treatment of patients under the care of medical practitioners and/or medical teams to which they are attached.\nStudents who have achieved a high standard in the BMed may undertake a one year program of supervised research leading to the award of the BSc(Med) Honours. Students wishing to undertake a full year of research may be able to enrol in the BSc (Med) Honours program 3831 subject to the approval from the Honours Committee. These students will be exempt from undertaking the Independent Learning Project. Exemption from the Independent Learning Project will also be granted to students who have previously completed a research Honours program or higher research degree, or a Master degree with a significant research component, or who can otherwise demonstrate acceptable evidence of independent study or research at a tertiary level.",

        "overview": "The program offers a comprehensive education in the area of health and exercise science with a focus on the use of physical activity as a preventative and rehabilitative therapy. Four years of full-time study leads to the award of a Bachelor of Exercise Physiology. A total of 192 units of credit must be successfully completed for the award of this degree. Graduates may expect to find employment as Accredited Exercise Physiologists (AEP) in rehabilitation clinics and hospitals working in post-acute rehabilitation, sports medicine clinics, corporate health, specialised fitness centres, and private practice for rehabilitation/exercise prescription for people requiring specialist guidance (e.g. workplace rehabilitation). The Bachelor of Exercise Physiology is accredited by the national governing body, Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA). Graduates are eligible to become members of ESSA and practice as Accredited Exercise Physiologists and Accredited Exercise Scientists.\nProgram Structure\nFoundation science courses are an important component of the early stages of the program and include chemistry, molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, statistics and psychology. Building on this knowledge base, the medical sciences of anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology are studied concurrently with the exercise science sub-disciplines of biomechanics, motor control and exercise psychology - leading to an integrated understanding of human function in health and disease and how this is impacted by exercise. The professional role of Exercise Physiologists is emphasised from the commencement of the program in Stage 1 exercise science courses. Clinical courses in Stage 3 cover the four broad areas of practice for Exercise Physiologists being, 1) the primary prevention of disease in apparently healthy populations, 2) the management of chronic diseases under the broad categories of cardiopulmonary and metabolic conditions, 3) musculoskeletal conditions and work hardening and 4) neuromuscular conditions. Courses offer a mixture of traditional and interactive/case study approaches to learning.\nStudents are required to complete a minimum of 12 UOC of research courses in their final year. The majority of students achieve this through enrolment in HESC4501 Exercise Physiology Research Seminars and then HESC4551 Research Project. However, students can opt to take an additional 6 UOC of research by enrolling in a supervised research internship. Selection of this additional research component improves student eligibility and preparedness for entry into higher degree research programs (e.g. Masters by Research; PhD). Students who choose to take a total of 18 UOC of 4th year research can take HESC4501 Exercise Physiology Research Seminars, then HESC4561 Research Internship A followed by HESC4571 Research Internship B. Enrolment in HESC4561 and HESC4571 will constitute the first and second halves, respectively, of a 20-week supervised research internship.\nStudents are required to take one elective course (6 UOC) throughout their program. This allows students to select a course according to their areas of interest and career specialisation. These may include: a research internship, or coursework focusing on cardiopulmonary conditions, metabolic conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, neuromuscular conditions, nutrition, mental health, and rehabilitation biomechanics. Specific elective courses available are listed below under Electives.\nGeneral Education is a requirement of all undergraduate programs at UNSW Sydney. Elective and General Education courses in Stage 4 provide flexibility to facilitate international exchange in the latter stage of the program, while still completing the core courses and practicum required to be eligible to become an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.",

Because of the overlap of 24 units of credit of Science courses in both core, the total units of credit required for completion is 240 UOC, rather than 264 UOC (please see Academic Rules below for more details).",

This double degree also requires students to complete 12 UOC of Free Electives.\nIn this double degree students take 168 UOC for the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) and 96 UOC for the Bachelor of Computer Science, for a total of 264 UOC. Because the courses required for both degrees overlap, the total minimum UOC required for the double degree is reduced by 24 UOC to 240 UOC.\nDepending on the chosen combination of Engineering stream and Computer Science major there may be more than 24 UOC of overlapping courses. When a student meets all the requirements for both degrees in less than 240 UOC, students must complete additional elective courses (on top of the required 12 UOC of free electives) to bring the total to 240 UOC. Students must take these additional electives from Faculty of Engineering and/or the School of Computer Science\nSome courses are double counted. Additionally the course overlaps require students to replace the usual course in one core or major with a more advanced course required in the other program. Specifically,\n\nStudents MUST take COMP1511 as their first year Engineering computing course, COMP1511 is then double counted towards both degrees\nCOMP1521 is a core requirement (BSc) and is double counted towards the BE(Hons) as a first year Engineering elective.

The two Maths course are double counted towards both degrees.\nCOMP4920 is required for the BSc, however students do not enrol in this course, and instead double count the management or ethics course in their chosen Engineering stream. Students take a free elective with the 6uoc freed up from not taking COMP4920\nMATH1081 is a core requirement (BSc) but is replaced by the 2nd year Maths course taken in the BE(Hons) major.
