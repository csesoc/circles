See: https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/cross-institutional-study. Each course of cross-institutional study requires approval from the German Studies convenor, with whom students must consult at an early stage to discuss the selection of courses. Students who successfully complete German Studies courses cross-institutionally will have their results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, i.e. specific grades will not appear on their transcript. If in a given term you are unable to take appropriate courses cross-institutionally you may be eligible to apply for an individual variation of program."
