                "description": "Students in the intermediate and advanced sequences who will complete some components of their sequence via cross-institutional study are advised that they are responsible for enrolling themselves before the appropriate UNSW and partner university deadlines for cross-institutional enrolment, which fall well before the beginning of regular UNSW teaching periods. See: https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/cross-institutional-study. Each course of cross-institutional study requires approval from the German Studies convenor, with whom students must consult at an early stage to discuss the selection of courses. Students who successfully complete German Studies courses cross-institutionally will have their results reported as transfer credits at UNSW, i.e. specific grades will not appear on their transcript. If in a given term you are unable to take appropriate courses cross-institutionally you may be eligible to apply for an individual variation of program."
