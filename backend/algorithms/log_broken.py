"""Logs all broken conditions to backend/algorithms/errors.txt

This file calls a secondary function make_condition() instead of the main
create_condition(). This is because our main focus is not on exclusions or such,
it is just to see if the condition is parsed properly. We also need the index
for debugging purposes.

Run from the backend directory with python3 -m algorithms.log_broken
