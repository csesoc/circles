"65GRADE in COMP1927"

"MATH1231 || DPST1014 || MATH1241 || MATH1251 each with 70GRADE"
--> 70GRADE in (MATH1231 || DPST1014 || MATH1241 || MATH1251)
UPDATE: I am gonna change this to:
70GRADE in MATH1231 || 70GRADE in DPST1014 || 70GRADE in MATH1241 || 70GRADE in MATH1251
for now cause way easier to code... 
In the future we might do something with multiple categories



Average of 2 Level 2 MATH courses
"12UOC in L2 Mathematics with an average 70GRADE"
--> 70GRADE in (12UOC in L2 MATH)
... This is kind of hard... I can try to code it when you're gone and if I can't
do it by the time you come back, we can discuss
UPDATE: LOL LET'S NOT BOTHER WITH THIS
